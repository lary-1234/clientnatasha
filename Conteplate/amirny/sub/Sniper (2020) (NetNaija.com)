1
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,203
I am a military writer

2
00:00:49,294 --> 00:00:50,586
I often think

3
00:00:51,457 --> 00:00:52,628
What is justice

4
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:54,459
perhaps

5
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:55,842
Parallel time and space

6
00:00:56,763 --> 00:00:59,557
There are also such a group
of peace-loving people

7
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:03,431
Fight endlessly for justice

8
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:22,414
Do not kill me

9
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:26,338
Please don't kill me

10
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:31,635
Mr. Adams

11
00:01:34,598 --> 00:01:36,849
Your people are not willing to pay

12
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,972
No no no

13
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,604
Let me talk to the embassy

14
00:01:40,316 --> 00:01:41,938
They will give it

15
00:01:42,107 --> 00:01:43,689
Your people won't care about you

16
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,730
No no no

17
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:47,074
They might be the wrong person

18
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,445
Too late

19
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:51,489
No no no no don't don't

20
00:02:14,307 --> 00:02:15,358
Report location

21
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:23,658
Get it done

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,452
Alpha in place

23
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:37,294
Bravo in place

24
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:44,143
Are you in place

25
00:02:52,732 --> 00:02:53,774
Charile in place

26
00:02:54,355 --> 00:02:55,695
Your people are waiting for a good show

27
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:56,568
No no no

28
00:02:56,658 --> 00:02:57,698
I beg you

29
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,240
Must be wrong

30
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:00,411
no no

31
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:02,033
You will die beautifully

32
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:03,416
400 meters away

33
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:06,209
Wind speed five meters per second

34
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,422
Amend 0.2

35
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:10,875
Request to shoot

36
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:14,129
Listen to my orders

37
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,470
three

38
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,530
action

39
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,721
action

40
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:14,944
To save the hostages

41
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:23,204
You owe me a glass of wine

42
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:32,345
Two machine guns

43
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:38,932
Sight blocked

44
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:55,823
Inaccessible hostages

45
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:57,875
Kill them

46
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:09,390
Mike

47
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,590
I have an opponent

48
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:16,398
Have a sniper

49
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
The machine gun is too strong

50
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:27,702
Another sniper

51
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:29,494
We can't last long

52
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:31,326
Perform Tactic 22

53
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:43,471
Wind speed 15

54
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:44,882
Distance 500

55
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:46,975
Depression angle 5 degrees

56
00:06:48,596 --> 00:06:49,308
Mike

57
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:50,519
Till you show

58
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,550
Playing the black cat game again

59
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:53,812
You can do it

60
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:55,275
You three o'clock

61
00:06:55,445 --> 00:06:56,276
roof

62
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:57,988
I won't owe you the wine

63
00:07:03,614 --> 00:07:04,076
year old

64
00:07:04,246 --> 00:07:05,246
Are you ready

65
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:06,407
Always

66
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,213
hit me

67
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:26,683
You are my best wingman

68
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:41,621
Get it done

69
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:43,163
Go forward

70
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:18,415
Put down the gun

71
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:20,418
He told us to lay down our weapons

72
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,549
Let me go

73
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:22,709
do not come

74
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:24,301
calm

75
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:25,963
We lay down our weapons

76
00:08:26,134 --> 00:08:26,465
what

77
00:08:27,136 --> 00:08:27,967
lay down your weapon

78
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:29,388
Put down the gun

79
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:30,559
Don't move

80
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:37,608
Take hostages

81
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:38,439
Let me go

82
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:39,651
He's okay

83
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:41,322
Don't move

84
00:08:41,323 --> 00:08:42,323
Too risky

85
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:43,405
No way

86
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:44,656
They are too close

87
00:08:44,777 --> 00:08:45,908
I want to take him away

88
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:47,530
Just safe

89
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:48,831
you

90
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:50,033
Don't move

91
00:08:50,242 --> 00:08:51,242
Don't worry

92
00:08:52,495 --> 00:08:54,088
You can't take him away

93
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:55,419
I can handle him

94
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,962
Don't disrupt my plan

95
00:08:57,963 --> 00:08:59,383
what did you say

96
00:08:59,795 --> 00:09:00,966
He didn't find me

97
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:01,928
Don't mess around

98
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:02,929
To shut up

99
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:04,431
Won't hit the deadly part

100
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:05,101
No way

101
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:05,932
I warn you

102
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:08,145
To shut up

103
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,491
how about it

104
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:22,162
fast

105
00:09:22,322 --> 00:09:24,874
I'm dying

106
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,247
The bullet pierced his shoulder

107
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:27,497
Not too optimistic

108
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:18,849
High surname

109
00:10:19,942 --> 00:10:20,893
I call you high

110
00:10:20,893 --> 00:10:21,893
You are deaf

111
00:10:23,396 --> 00:10:24,107
What a joke

112
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:25,107
High surname

113
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:26,359
No money

114
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:29,032
Ask for money

115
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:39,214
I ask you

116
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:41,337
Do you know what i did today

117
00:10:41,588 --> 00:10:43,068
Is there no sacrifice to save people?

118
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,510
What is the injury

119
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:46,724
You almost killed the hostage

120
00:10:46,884 --> 00:10:49,427
Could it be that the gangster
took the hostage away?

121
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:51,389
We both know

122
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,060
That hostage

123
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,103
Impossible to get out alive

124
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:55,103
I told you

125
00:10:55,985 --> 00:10:56,776
I have my plan

126
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:58,107
Why are there so many boxes

127
00:10:58,738 --> 00:10:59,990
I am not a newcomer

128
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,640
To complete the task is to plan

129
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:05,946
I have been here for three years

130
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:07,539
Never made a mistake

131
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,912
Do you know what it depends on

132
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:14,457
Obey orders and execute tactics

133
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,591
Minimize the possible mistakes

134
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:18,802
do you understand

135
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:19,802
I do not understand

136
00:11:21,175 --> 00:11:22,455
I have completed the task anyway

137
00:11:23,178 --> 00:11:25,100
What other fights and troubles

138
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:26,602
non of my business

139
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:28,643
it is good

140
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:31,897
and many more

141
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:34,071
You told me clearly

142
00:11:34,732 --> 00:11:36,444
Are you hitting me in the back

143
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:38,034
I tell you

144
00:11:38,286 --> 00:11:39,487
Something rushing to me

145
00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:40,989
Don't tell me anything else

146
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,770
You should have seen the contract

147
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:44,083
The company has the right

148
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:47,797
Deduction of compensation for team
members who caused hostage injuries

149
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:49,588
I don't care

150
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,382
I just want my share back

151
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:58,099
I tell you

152
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:01,354
If it's not because of my little report

153
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:04,517
You are not even qualified
to stand here and talk to me

154
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:07,270
I apply to quit the Tigers

155
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:07,861
I approve

156
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:08,903
what

157
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:10,485
With my sniper level

158
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:12,777
I can eat everywhere

159
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:15,911
Really treat yourself as a regular army

160
00:12:16,332 --> 00:12:17,954
You must not insult my faith

161
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:20,537
The one i want

162
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:23,289
Much better than your
three-legged cat troop

163
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,290
Don't insult Lei Bao

164
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:26,503
listen

165
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:28,346
You are the insult of Lei Bao

166
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:29,967
you

167
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:31,389
let it go

168
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,181
release

169
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:33,181
Nothing to do with you

170
00:12:34,143 --> 00:12:35,143
Go away

171
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:36,685
Are you looking for death?

172
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:00,465
Stop making trouble, buddy

173
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:50,063
Sorry Captain Gao

174
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:52,987
I'm late

175
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:54,819
Hello there

176
00:13:57,654 --> 00:13:58,654
enough

177
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:02,999
stand up

178
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:13,763
Because Mr. Adams was injured

179
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:15,806
We need to accept an urgent task

180
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:18,809
To repair our relationship
with important customers

181
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:23,735
In recent years, the economy of
Sakia has continued to develop

182
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:27,295
But because a group of international
bandits committed crimes across the border

183
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:29,742
Greatly disrupted regional
peace and stability

184
00:14:30,243 --> 00:14:32,446
The current situation here is very severe

185
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:36,156
The culprits did not hesitate to use Agent
Orange and other biological weapons

186
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,122
The people suffer

187
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,797
And our task this time is to assist

188
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:43,758
Escorting the International
Peace Foundation

189
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:44,759
Supplies

190
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:47,304
Go to the aided area in the north

191
00:14:51,469 --> 00:14:52,469
Hello everyone

192
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,810
I'm Lucian Chen

193
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:55,472
I am the International Peace Foundation

194
00:14:55,473 --> 00:14:57,316
project manager

195
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:58,607
What's in the truck

196
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,901
Food seed water purifier

197
00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:03,071
No dangerous goods

198
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:05,445
That's the gangster's place

199
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:06,827
This is our job

200
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:08,119
We need your escort

201
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:11,993
All right

202
00:15:12,163 --> 00:15:13,163
Full hearing

203
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,626
We leave at 12 o'clock

204
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,549
Extremely dangerous equipment level

205
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:17,839
Disband

206
00:15:19,923 --> 00:15:21,595
What do you think this is

207
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,178
Come and go

208
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:26,761
What you say is not a trifle

209
00:15:26,851 --> 00:15:29,394
This escort will pass through
the bandit control area

210
00:15:29,815 --> 00:15:31,016
12 o'clock departure

211
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:32,768
Where do you find someone

212
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:35,191
Don't be ashamed if you want to join

213
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:36,572
But with conditions

214
00:15:37,364 --> 00:15:38,364
What condition

215
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:40,027
First absolute obedience

216
00:15:40,237 --> 00:15:40,698
second

217
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:43,200
You descend from a sniper to an escort

218
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:44,743
Only use P90

219
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:52,592
no problem

220
00:15:53,043 --> 00:15:54,043
Captain Gao

221
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:56,597
I want to see your tactical command

222
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:58,389
How awesome is it

223
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,570
beauty

224
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:50,742
Been here for a few years

225
00:16:51,163 --> 00:16:52,163
Four years

226
00:16:52,785 --> 00:16:53,785
Just kidding

227
00:16:54,707 --> 00:16:56,627
The conflict here only
broke out for three years

228
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:57,670
Before the war

229
00:16:57,671 --> 00:16:59,952
I'm here as a volunteer for
an international organization

230
00:17:00,294 --> 00:17:01,294
Is there a problem

231
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:02,876
no problem

232
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:05,930
How much can we earn after
finishing this ticket

233
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:07,471
estimate

234
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:09,635
Enough for you to eat and drink

235
00:17:10,686 --> 00:17:12,058
Two lifetimes

236
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:16,693
You can also engage in some chicks singing

237
00:17:25,364 --> 00:17:27,156
Then why did you choose to come here

238
00:17:28,036 --> 00:17:30,765
Compared to standing in an office
building and eating a twenty-dollar lunch

239
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:32,122
Watching the news

240
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:34,164
Falsely express an angry expression

241
00:17:34,415 --> 00:17:36,718
I would rather stand here
and eat my mouthful of sand

242
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:38,259
At least we are doing things

243
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,761
You think too simple

244
00:17:40,883 --> 00:17:41,883
Just like us

245
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:44,676
I thought I could win

246
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:45,678
save lives

247
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:47,390
Actually the reality is cruel

248
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:49,433
But at least we have hope

249
00:17:49,643 --> 00:17:50,733
As long as we are here

250
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:51,854
As long as we are doing work

251
00:17:52,026 --> 00:17:53,346
There is hope to end the conflict

252
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:55,320
The conflict will never end

253
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,600
Because there will be conflicts
where there are people

254
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,996
Otherwise, what shall we eat

255
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:02,699
Where can I make money anyway

256
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,700
Where i go

257
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:08,222
If you don’t need a doctor because
you have eliminated the disease

258
00:18:08,506 --> 00:18:10,048
So does the doctor need not exist?

259
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:13,342
Hey guys

260
00:18:13,762 --> 00:18:14,762
We have some trouble

261
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:15,884
what's the situation

262
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:37,451
The engine is too hot

263
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:38,741
We ran out of freezing fluid

264
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:40,835
This is our drinking water

265
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,206
Can't you use other

266
00:18:42,297 --> 00:18:44,129
There is no other water

267
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,301
The temperature is too high

268
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,714
Even if the engine can be restarted

269
00:18:49,135 --> 00:18:50,306
Can't last too long

270
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:52,008
We need freezing fluid

271
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:54,061
We are in this ghost place

272
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:55,643
I know a place

273
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:59,147
Government checkpoint

274
00:18:59,477 --> 00:19:01,570
Only 30 minutes drive

275
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:03,482
Are you sure you have antifreeze

276
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:05,154
I know the commander there

277
00:19:05,324 --> 00:19:06,324
Gates

278
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:09,329
How about the engine

279
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:10,619
thirty minutes

280
00:19:10,831 --> 00:19:12,071
Should be able to hold it there

281
00:19:38,404 --> 00:19:39,404
Sir

282
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:40,696
The team is coming

283
00:19:40,737 --> 00:19:41,737
Sir

284
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,450
The team is coming

285
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,170
Every time we ship supplies

286
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:53,171
Will pass by here

287
00:19:53,212 --> 00:19:55,254
These guys don't look very friendly

288
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:57,797
I have never been with armed men

289
00:19:58,178 --> 00:20:00,761
They might be nervous when
they see your weapons

290
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:02,013
Stay alert

291
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:11,523
Stop

292
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:13,446
get off

293
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:20,034
I am high

294
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:22,143
This is the car of the
International Rescue Organization

295
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:23,288
You can't pass

296
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:26,171
I want to see your commander gates

297
00:20:26,172 --> 00:20:27,623
We want to check the whole car

298
00:20:28,124 --> 00:20:29,124
Where is gates

299
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:36,012
All get off

300
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,120
This is the International
Peace Foundation vehicle

301
00:21:00,163 --> 00:21:02,505
Protected by international law

302
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:04,127
Let your chief come out

303
00:21:04,338 --> 00:21:05,469
No matter who he is

304
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:08,673
I think so

305
00:21:09,804 --> 00:21:10,804
I count 123

306
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:11,977
We both shoot together

307
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:13,347
Alright

308
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:18,143
Ok

309
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,888
This lady followed me to see the chief

310
00:21:32,912 --> 00:21:33,913
Others stay

311
00:21:34,164 --> 00:21:35,164
Come with me

312
00:21:37,668 --> 00:21:38,668
Be careful

313
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:56,029
I'm Lucian Chen

314
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:56,981
From the International Peace Foundation

315
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:58,152
I'm Captain Max

316
00:21:58,733 --> 00:21:59,733
Where's Gates

317
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:01,905
He was transferred to another
checkpoint last week

318
00:22:03,118 --> 00:22:03,659
Ok

319
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,541
According to international law

320
00:22:05,702 --> 00:22:07,242
You can't stop our vehicles from passing

321
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,391
We are the International Peace Foundation

322
00:22:08,415 --> 00:22:09,046
Sorry

323
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:10,497
But according to the superior order

324
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:11,587
No one can pass

325
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,921
Can i talk to your superior

326
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:14,961
of course

327
00:22:18,257 --> 00:22:19,388
I am max

328
00:22:19,758 --> 00:22:21,350
Please connect to the superior

329
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:27,318
(Local language)

330
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:35,738
I have an ominous hunch

331
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,780
Yes

332
00:22:39,372 --> 00:22:41,284
These soldiers are a little nervous

333
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:45,088
Ok

334
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:52,967
Ok

335
00:22:55,261 --> 00:22:56,261
Gates is dead

336
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:57,353
All misunderstanding

337
00:22:57,644 --> 00:22:58,395
friend

338
00:22:58,645 --> 00:22:59,226
Relax

339
00:22:59,606 --> 00:23:00,606
Relax

340
00:23:05,524 --> 00:23:06,524
ready

341
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:10,950
Sorry

342
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,070
You can pass

343
00:23:12,452 --> 00:23:13,874
Please sign here

344
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
dry

345
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:08,389
Will use it

346
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,060
I don't kill

347
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,580
They will kill you if you don't kill

348
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:17,360
I'll send a few more people to hold them

349
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:18,572
What did you say

350
00:24:18,902 --> 00:24:19,902
Go fast

351
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:39,677
Does anyone need special services

352
00:24:39,887 --> 00:24:41,059
Five-star praise

353
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,529
Reinforcements are coming

354
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,650
I saw

355
00:24:51,822 --> 00:24:52,822
Two pickup trucks

356
00:24:54,154 --> 00:24:55,246
We perform tactics No. 8

357
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,077
You hold on

358
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,424
Where are you going

359
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:32,289
Desperate

360
00:26:25,895 --> 00:26:27,016
Luo Xinglie

361
00:26:27,897 --> 00:26:28,979
Brat

362
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:30,930
I'll settle accounts with you

363
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:13,162
Kill that guy

364
00:27:13,362 --> 00:27:14,453
fast

365
00:27:15,074 --> 00:27:16,074
cover me

366
00:27:24,425 --> 00:27:25,837
Dig guy

367
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,380
gold

368
00:27:55,873 --> 00:27:57,545
Cool

369
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,938
True 6

370
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:52,982
Sniper

371
00:28:59,991 --> 00:29:00,991
I can't figure it out

372
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:03,335
How did the government
forces here be bought?

373
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:04,836
They are not bought

374
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:06,588
I found out when I came

375
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:08,380
Judging from what they wear

376
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:09,502
They are gangsters

377
00:29:09,672 --> 00:29:11,675
So why they pretend to be government troops

378
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:12,506
Don't know yet

379
00:29:12,806 --> 00:29:13,806
It's too dangerous

380
00:29:14,138 --> 00:29:15,259
We have to leave right away

381
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:29,236
Almost hit our goods

382
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:30,947
no problem

383
00:29:30,948 --> 00:29:33,160
We will still point to it
for the rest of our lives

384
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:35,033
Good luck

385
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,249
After we hit the road

386
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,251
The situation has changed

387
00:29:43,423 --> 00:29:46,503
The gangster issued a statement to launch
an all-out attack on the government

388
00:29:47,097 --> 00:29:49,430
And destroy the second largest city

389
00:29:50,011 --> 00:29:52,474
These people are crazy

390
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:55,163
They don’t take other people’s
countries and people seriously

391
00:29:55,187 --> 00:29:56,438
The situation is tense now

392
00:29:57,019 --> 00:29:58,521
If we continue this mission

393
00:29:59,192 --> 00:30:00,943
May take a big risk

394
00:30:00,944 --> 00:30:03,304
If the water purifier and seeds
cannot be delivered in time

395
00:30:03,527 --> 00:30:05,448
Villagers there may miss
the planting season

396
00:30:05,449 --> 00:30:07,412
They will starve to death
before next spring

397
00:30:08,163 --> 00:30:09,163
I know all this

398
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:11,667
But that can’t be risky

399
00:30:12,127 --> 00:30:13,419
But we've got here

400
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,672
Let's vote

401
00:30:18,715 --> 00:30:19,715
Ok

402
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:21,429
We vote by show of hands

403
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,550
carry on

404
00:30:27,936 --> 00:30:28,936
go back

405
00:30:33,403 --> 00:30:34,403
Luo Xinglie

406
00:30:35,155 --> 00:30:36,276
What is your attitude

407
00:30:45,668 --> 00:30:46,668
carry on

408
00:30:51,835 --> 00:30:52,835
Ok

409
00:30:53,427 --> 00:30:54,427
Mission continues

410
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:56,801
But I clearly stipulate that
we must be very cautious

411
00:30:57,262 --> 00:30:58,343
We rest in the car

412
00:30:58,804 --> 00:30:59,804
Depart at dawn

413
00:30:59,975 --> 00:31:00,975
One hour rotation

414
00:31:01,096 --> 00:31:01,637
Victor

415
00:31:02,098 --> 00:31:03,188
Confiscated his sniper rifle

416
00:31:03,189 --> 00:31:04,189
what

417
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:05,602
why

418
00:31:05,892 --> 00:31:06,943
You disobey my order

419
00:31:07,234 --> 00:31:08,696
Now you are just an escort

420
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:10,818
Keep your sniper rifle Victor

421
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:15,152
Isn't this nonsense?

422
00:31:15,364 --> 00:31:16,495
It's not fair

423
00:31:16,705 --> 00:31:17,705
brothers

424
00:31:17,907 --> 00:31:19,579
You broke the rules

425
00:31:21,211 --> 00:31:24,083
Customized M14 with 8x lens

426
00:31:24,084 --> 00:31:26,126
0.7M9A accuracy

427
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:30,422
175 grain game ammunition

428
00:31:30,592 --> 00:31:31,633
Real player

429
00:31:32,094 --> 00:31:33,555
Treat my baby well

430
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,480
Any question

431
00:31:39,102 --> 00:31:40,102
Disband

432
00:31:55,452 --> 00:31:56,452
Too damn

433
00:31:58,205 --> 00:31:59,507
You don't need me to take it

434
00:32:05,844 --> 00:32:07,967
Thank you for your key vote just now

435
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:10,198
The villagers there will appreciate you

436
00:32:11,311 --> 00:32:12,893
I'm not as great as you said

437
00:32:13,854 --> 00:32:14,854
According to the contract

438
00:32:15,606 --> 00:32:17,028
In such a tense situation

439
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:20,362
I can get an additional 20% subsidy

440
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:24,866
correct

441
00:32:25,118 --> 00:32:27,951
Is there any conflict between
you and Captain Gao?

442
00:32:29,042 --> 00:32:30,494
You haven't heard a word

443
00:32:31,205 --> 00:32:33,127
Do you call your peers lighter?

444
00:32:33,748 --> 00:32:34,999
Two snipers

445
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:38,213
Only one can be the strongest

446
00:32:39,755 --> 00:32:41,136
Captain Gao 10 years ago

447
00:32:41,137 --> 00:32:43,138
Represented Lei Bao in Venezuela

448
00:32:43,139 --> 00:32:44,561
Sniper game of hunter school

449
00:32:44,851 --> 00:32:45,851
Won first

450
00:32:46,473 --> 00:32:47,473
Lei Bao

451
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:51,149
You are just an assaulter
with shooting talent

452
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,982
It's normal for him not
to take you seriously

453
00:32:57,657 --> 00:32:58,657
I went to sleep

454
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:12,094
If the main road is only 100 kilometers

455
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:14,045
But it has to go through the
bandits and government forces

456
00:33:14,046 --> 00:33:15,678
High-risk zone for crossfire

457
00:33:24,189 --> 00:33:25,190
Highlander

458
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:29,615
So you are the legendary Thunder
Leopard sniper codenamed Highlander

459
00:33:31,157 --> 00:33:32,369
I wonder

460
00:33:34,031 --> 00:33:35,242
Just now

461
00:33:36,163 --> 00:33:38,326
Can maintain such a high hit rate

462
00:33:38,536 --> 00:33:39,536
Highlander

463
00:33:40,168 --> 00:33:41,540
Can you teach me a few tricks

464
00:33:45,885 --> 00:33:47,297
Really out of sight

465
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:50,340
Did you sit down?

466
00:34:01,153 --> 00:34:02,153
Sit down

467
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:08,640
Don't you always want to see
me making a fool of yourself

468
00:34:08,953 --> 00:34:09,953
Misunderstanding

469
00:34:10,785 --> 00:34:12,036
But then again

470
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:13,327
The shot just now

471
00:34:13,328 --> 00:34:14,328
I am convinced

472
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,370
Speak the truth

473
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:18,714
I just found out today

474
00:34:19,175 --> 00:34:20,336
My own limitations

475
00:34:20,927 --> 00:34:24,181
Is the lack of precision
at critical moments

476
00:34:25,803 --> 00:34:27,305
Actually you are very normal

477
00:34:28,345 --> 00:34:29,847
Each of us snipers

478
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:32,350
At every critical moment

479
00:34:33,022 --> 00:34:34,352
It's possible to make mistakes

480
00:34:34,944 --> 00:34:37,317
Then how are you at the critical moment

481
00:34:38,198 --> 00:34:40,108
Can still maintain such high accuracy

482
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:41,110
Did you see it

483
00:34:41,322 --> 00:34:42,322
what is this

484
00:34:43,653 --> 00:34:44,826
It's like your heart

485
00:34:46,788 --> 00:34:48,290
Young and vigorous

486
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,504
Only water can kill it

487
00:34:52,664 --> 00:34:53,916
Heart is like water

488
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:56,419
But sometimes

489
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:58,131
You say on the battlefield

490
00:34:58,803 --> 00:35:00,173
Adrenaline rush

491
00:35:00,595 --> 00:35:01,595
Can't control it

492
00:35:02,426 --> 00:35:03,598
You are too young

493
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:04,428
You have experienced

494
00:35:04,428 --> 00:35:05,428
Will find

495
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,931
Victory or defeat

496
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,606
Not made of impulse and passion

497
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:11,397
Victory or defeat

498
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,363
Mainly patience and suffering

499
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,949
Since you are a senior of Lei Bao

500
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,701
Then you are my master

501
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:24,664
I don’t have your apprentice

502
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,627
You're welcome, Master

503
00:35:27,878 --> 00:35:29,129
Teach me a few tricks

504
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:31,551
You really want to learn

505
00:35:31,552 --> 00:35:32,552
Ok

506
00:35:33,304 --> 00:35:34,345
Say so

507
00:35:35,347 --> 00:35:37,269
If you can strictly implement my tactics

508
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,060
I will teach you

509
00:35:40,353 --> 00:35:41,354
Absolutely obey

510
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:46,570
did you see it

511
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:48,481
Pierced this box of needles

512
00:35:49,784 --> 00:35:50,865
Threading

513
00:35:52,828 --> 00:35:55,161
What does piercing have to do with sniping?

514
00:36:06,304 --> 00:36:07,966
I said did you find this way on purpose

515
00:36:09,097 --> 00:36:10,599
Did you not go through a needle?

516
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:11,809
Don't make noise

517
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,774
I went in

518
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,114
see it

519
00:36:24,236 --> 00:36:25,407
see it

520
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,741
My needle

521
00:36:28,741 --> 00:36:29,741
I

522
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:32,875
Aged

523
00:36:33,377 --> 00:36:34,377
Sorry

524
00:36:58,367 --> 00:36:59,527
25 old

525
00:36:59,528 --> 00:37:01,911
25 pieces

526
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:03,162
Master 25

527
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:55,135
This is the only food they
can entertain guests here

528
00:37:56,346 --> 00:37:57,346
Thank you

529
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,612
Good everyone eat something and unload

530
00:38:09,823 --> 00:38:10,823
Thank you

531
00:38:11,074 --> 00:38:12,074
Thank you

532
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:31,929
Something you find hard to swallow

533
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,300
Is the most precious food here

534
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:35,854
We brought food

535
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,820
You come with me

536
00:38:50,452 --> 00:38:51,122
What's inside

537
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:52,124
too heavy

538
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:53,374
I do not know either

539
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:54,916
Just a bunch of seed crops

540
00:39:07,022 --> 00:39:08,143
in my country

541
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:12,438
Seeds are almost everything

542
00:39:12,939 --> 00:39:14,731
Then you are lucky to leave there

543
00:39:18,405 --> 00:39:19,405
Stop

544
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:24,151
Boss, let me go and make it easier

545
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:26,245
I also need to go

546
00:39:49,983 --> 00:39:51,275
Gangsters just want power

547
00:39:51,866 --> 00:39:53,106
Regardless of international law

548
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:55,898
Secretly used prohibited
biological and chemical weapons

549
00:39:56,331 --> 00:39:58,744
The villagers here are the
victims of Agent Orange

550
00:40:00,416 --> 00:40:02,208
The water here can no longer be used

551
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,752
That's why you risk your life

552
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:10,638
The reason why the water purifier
and seeds are also sent here

553
00:40:13,101 --> 00:40:14,302
Although i don't know

554
00:40:14,303 --> 00:40:16,726
How much change and help
can I bring to them

555
00:40:17,226 --> 00:40:19,399
But I also want to prevent
conflicts in my way

556
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,693
Bring even a little hope to their lives

557
00:40:22,813 --> 00:40:24,365
How can you stop it alone

558
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:29,161
Now i still have you

559
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:08,668
Unexpectedly on this contaminated land

560
00:41:08,918 --> 00:41:10,210
Can grow dandelions

561
00:41:11,421 --> 00:41:12,833
That we still have hope

562
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:15,046
No matter how bad the world is

563
00:41:15,126 --> 00:41:16,548
Hope still exists

564
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,132
It's a pity that I can't do anything

565
00:41:21,263 --> 00:41:22,263
Not a politician

566
00:41:22,555 --> 00:41:23,766
Can't help you

567
00:41:25,018 --> 00:41:26,018
Sorry

568
00:41:30,194 --> 00:41:31,235
In case

569
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:34,318
Roger that

570
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,540
what's the situation

571
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,581
At our convenience

572
00:41:44,582 --> 00:41:46,713
Someone attacked us with a silencer weapon

573
00:41:46,714 --> 00:41:49,007
The bastard actually put a cold gun

574
00:41:49,547 --> 00:41:50,549
My shoulder is broken

575
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,090
calm down

576
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:53,488
Did you see the person who shot

577
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,264
Did not see

578
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:57,475
He has to dare to come out
and I will destroy him

579
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:03,394
I have a bad feeling

580
00:42:04,185 --> 00:42:05,186
There may be an ambush

581
00:42:12,745 --> 00:42:13,745
There is an ambush

582
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:15,539
A group of two

583
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,450
Evacuated people

584
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,000
fast

585
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:18,121
Hurry up

586
00:42:21,836 --> 00:42:22,836
go

587
00:42:28,134 --> 00:42:29,425
Victor follows me

588
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:51,411
Why do gangsters appear here

589
00:42:51,492 --> 00:42:52,994
There may be a barracks nearby

590
00:42:53,124 --> 00:42:54,456
I know why

591
00:42:54,626 --> 00:42:55,337
what happened

592
00:42:55,417 --> 00:42:57,339
I see Agent Orange weapons
mixed in the cargo

593
00:42:57,499 --> 00:42:58,499
what

594
00:42:58,671 --> 00:42:59,671
Hurry up

595
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,391
team leader

596
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:24,031
They are coming

597
00:43:24,662 --> 00:43:25,373
I know there is an empty house

598
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:26,534
We can hide there

599
00:43:27,085 --> 00:43:27,625
let's go

600
00:43:28,036 --> 00:43:29,378
One two go

601
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:42,353
Are you ok

602
00:43:42,354 --> 00:43:43,975
Hurt me so much

603
00:44:02,077 --> 00:44:03,419
Such an old age

604
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,002
The response is not bad

605
00:44:06,793 --> 00:44:07,884
I know it is you

606
00:44:11,638 --> 00:44:12,638
Say

607
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,971
Why betray us

608
00:44:14,762 --> 00:44:17,145
They gave big money and a new identity

609
00:44:17,305 --> 00:44:18,477
You can't give it

610
00:44:18,727 --> 00:44:20,649
For that shit

611
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:23,693
You can kill so many innocent people

612
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,992
Dead

613
00:44:31,242 --> 00:44:33,415
No money and no identity

614
00:44:34,826 --> 00:44:37,500
This is what I learned
in the military court

615
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:40,213
You are an inhumane scum

616
00:44:42,295 --> 00:44:43,507
Let's play a game

617
00:44:45,259 --> 00:44:46,259
I promise

618
00:44:46,721 --> 00:44:49,684
I won't shoot until I count three

619
00:44:50,345 --> 00:44:51,345
I also promise

620
00:44:52,267 --> 00:44:53,309
You can't win

621
00:44:53,439 --> 00:44:54,439
ready

622
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,161
You belong to them

623
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:13,833
Right

624
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:15,465
I'm such a talented actor

625
00:45:16,507 --> 00:45:17,628
so fun

626
00:45:46,252 --> 00:45:47,252
Come boy

627
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:48,544
Get up

628
00:46:12,404 --> 00:46:14,947
Come here, there are more important things

629
00:46:15,738 --> 00:46:16,739
Sorry

630
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,663
I don't have time to play with you

631
00:46:33,009 --> 00:46:34,430
Old man closes the door

632
00:46:47,446 --> 00:46:48,197
Luo Xinglie

633
00:46:48,367 --> 00:46:48,988
gold

634
00:46:49,278 --> 00:46:50,278
Are you still alive

635
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:51,411
team leader

636
00:46:51,412 --> 00:46:52,622
I'm with Lucy Mike

637
00:46:52,953 --> 00:46:53,953
What's your situation

638
00:46:54,535 --> 00:46:55,535
Great

639
00:46:55,626 --> 00:46:56,667
Change our channel

640
00:47:00,252 --> 00:47:01,252
Channel 19 Channel 19

641
00:47:01,673 --> 00:47:02,673
you listen to me

642
00:47:04,046 --> 00:47:05,968
Victor and Gray betrayed us

643
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:07,300
I got hurt

644
00:47:08,512 --> 00:47:09,763
How is your situation

645
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:11,515
We are in an empty house

646
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:13,283
Should be able to top it for a while

647
00:47:13,307 --> 00:47:13,858
it is good

648
00:47:14,188 --> 00:47:15,456
Send me the location immediately

649
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,480
Roger that

650
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:34,291
Clam West

651
00:47:34,503 --> 00:47:35,503
When it's time to shoot

652
00:47:35,714 --> 00:47:36,714
do not hesitate

653
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:49,481
Now they know our plan

654
00:47:50,692 --> 00:47:52,024
We have to kill them

655
00:47:58,952 --> 00:48:00,574
Is there a problem with the goods?

656
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:03,917
Little trouble

657
00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:05,871
I will fix them soon

658
00:48:06,672 --> 00:48:08,374
Do you need help

659
00:48:10,126 --> 00:48:12,178
When we were serving

660
00:48:12,549 --> 00:48:14,381
I've seen more killers than you

661
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:16,433
Good luck brother

662
00:48:16,764 --> 00:48:18,185
God bless you

663
00:48:21,479 --> 00:48:22,479
close the door

664
00:48:26,816 --> 00:48:27,816
Captain Gao

665
00:48:28,027 --> 00:48:28,818
your hands

666
00:48:28,988 --> 00:48:29,739
Nothing

667
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:30,819
Not fatal

668
00:48:34,285 --> 00:48:36,157
Victor and Gray betrayed us

669
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,290
Deliberately took us to that checkpoint

670
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,121
Agent Orange

671
00:48:39,122 --> 00:48:40,211
From government territory

672
00:48:40,212 --> 00:48:41,413
Transported to the gangster

673
00:48:41,754 --> 00:48:42,754
Boss

674
00:48:43,085 --> 00:48:44,085
What are our plans now

675
00:48:44,127 --> 00:48:45,127
Don't worry

676
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:46,338
We can't fight hard

677
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:47,381
Find a car

678
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:48,172
rush out

679
00:48:48,382 --> 00:48:49,382
Ok

680
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:05,943
What do you mean, Captain

681
00:49:08,326 --> 00:49:09,407
My hands are gone

682
00:49:09,998 --> 00:49:12,251
You are now the number one
sniper of this tiger team

683
00:49:12,451 --> 00:49:13,451
But i

684
00:49:13,752 --> 00:49:14,914
We have no time

685
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:16,414
Hold

686
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:44,829
Kill them

687
00:49:46,372 --> 00:49:47,372
Kill them

688
00:49:47,543 --> 00:49:48,543
Kill them

689
00:49:48,664 --> 00:49:49,664
Kill them

690
00:49:49,706 --> 00:49:50,706
Kill them

691
00:49:51,298 --> 00:49:52,339
Mike go outside

692
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:53,549
Roger that

693
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:55,052
Luo Xinglie

694
00:49:55,052 --> 00:49:55,673
You go up

695
00:49:55,674 --> 00:49:56,963
I will be your watcher

696
00:49:56,964 --> 00:49:57,555
To understanding

697
00:49:57,555 --> 00:49:58,306
What can i do

698
00:49:58,426 --> 00:50:00,308
Find a place to protect yourself

699
00:50:01,009 --> 00:50:02,009
go

700
00:50:28,673 --> 00:50:29,753
Three o'clock

701
00:50:29,754 --> 00:50:30,425
Five people

702
00:50:30,595 --> 00:50:31,915
Just pay attention to fine-tuning

703
00:50:39,355 --> 00:50:40,355
Eleven o'clock direction

704
00:50:40,687 --> 00:50:41,687
Two people

705
00:50:41,728 --> 00:50:42,728
Kill him

706
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:52,241
Kill the back cover

707
00:50:56,496 --> 00:50:58,288
They move faster than expected

708
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,752
I start to miss my sniper rifle

709
00:51:02,543 --> 00:51:03,543
remember

710
00:51:04,336 --> 00:51:06,548
The best equipment for a
sniper rifle is a sniper

711
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:33,040
You are a sniper

712
00:51:33,671 --> 00:51:35,253
Just a stone

713
00:51:35,874 --> 00:51:37,045
No sound

714
00:51:37,546 --> 00:51:38,546
Not breathing

715
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:40,840
No trembling

716
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,561
Good job

717
00:51:54,065 --> 00:51:54,646
Captain Gao

718
00:51:54,696 --> 00:51:55,696
Are you OK

719
00:51:56,148 --> 00:51:57,148
I'm fine

720
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,170
This is just their first wave of offense

721
00:52:00,573 --> 00:52:01,573
team leader

722
00:52:03,076 --> 00:52:04,076
The three of you

723
00:52:04,828 --> 00:52:06,661
Go out and find a car

724
00:52:07,412 --> 00:52:08,412
I hold them

725
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:09,833
Go together

726
00:52:09,965 --> 00:52:10,545
50 kilometers away

727
00:52:10,546 --> 00:52:12,296
There is a town controlled
by government forces

728
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:12,758
We can

729
00:52:12,759 --> 00:52:14,050
Listen to me

730
00:52:18,014 --> 00:52:20,017
Someone must stay to stop them

731
00:52:21,348 --> 00:52:22,850
Buy time for everyone

732
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:33,443
This person is me

733
00:52:37,037 --> 00:52:38,249
I won't leave you

734
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:39,909
team leader

735
00:52:43,255 --> 00:52:45,007
My time is really running out

736
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:47,208
listen to me

737
00:52:49,172 --> 00:52:50,172
Master

738
00:52:52,175 --> 00:52:53,637
My needle is almost finished

739
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:57,602
You promised to continue teaching me

740
00:52:59,935 --> 00:53:01,647
If there is next life

741
00:53:02,688 --> 00:53:04,440
I will teach you well

742
00:53:06,653 --> 00:53:07,824
Do not be sad

743
00:53:09,036 --> 00:53:10,407
I am a sniper

744
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:14,743
Can die on the battlefield

745
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:18,747
Is my best home

746
00:53:23,003 --> 00:53:24,554
Luo Xinglie

747
00:53:32,394 --> 00:53:33,394
Luo Xinglie

748
00:53:34,817 --> 00:53:37,730
I now appoint you as the
captain of the Tigers

749
00:53:38,521 --> 00:53:41,154
Never let Agent Orange fall
into the hands of the gangster

750
00:53:42,616 --> 00:53:44,448
This is my last command

751
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,780
Go

752
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:51,587
Listen to the captain

753
00:55:08,009 --> 00:55:09,409
We still have a chance to save high

754
00:55:10,472 --> 00:55:12,224
We have to get a car first

755
00:55:12,635 --> 00:55:13,936
And then go back to rescue him

756
00:55:15,268 --> 00:55:16,268
listen

757
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:17,851
I'll lead them away

758
00:55:18,191 --> 00:55:19,233
You two go get a car

759
00:55:22,316 --> 00:55:23,568
I'll get the car by myself

760
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:24,449
Just do that

761
00:55:24,699 --> 00:55:25,699
Stay in contact

762
00:55:55,646 --> 00:55:57,108
My master taught me three tricks

763
00:55:59,241 --> 00:56:01,441
You have completed the first
trick to thread the needle

764
00:56:12,547 --> 00:56:14,049
The second trick is

765
00:56:16,922 --> 00:56:17,923
As a sniper

766
00:56:19,595 --> 00:56:20,967
You are a rock

767
00:56:22,018 --> 00:56:23,180
No sound

768
00:56:24,521 --> 00:56:25,643
Not breathing

769
00:56:27,395 --> 00:56:28,606
No trembling

770
00:56:29,067 --> 00:56:30,108
hold onto

771
00:56:45,837 --> 00:56:48,050
Finally there is a third trick

772
00:56:50,382 --> 00:56:52,134
As a sniper

773
00:56:54,347 --> 00:56:55,969
Always have plan B

774
00:56:58,893 --> 00:57:00,314
You are my plan b

775
00:58:12,311 --> 00:58:13,903
I am a sniper

776
00:58:14,734 --> 00:58:16,276
Can die on the battlefield

777
00:58:18,068 --> 00:58:20,321
Is my best home

778
00:58:55,453 --> 00:58:56,453
team leader

779
00:59:22,145 --> 00:59:23,487
Really touched

780
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:26,941
The fireworks are over

781
00:59:27,151 --> 00:59:28,692
It's time for us to talk
about serious matters

782
00:59:28,693 --> 00:59:29,284
leave me alone

783
00:59:29,285 --> 00:59:30,495
To shut up

784
00:59:33,118 --> 00:59:34,580
I give you one minute

785
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:38,375
Otherwise I can't guarantee
your girlfriend's safety

786
00:59:38,455 --> 00:59:39,916
He is not my boyfriend

787
00:59:39,917 --> 00:59:40,917
To shut up

788
00:59:52,061 --> 00:59:53,273
Let's face to face

789
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:56,857
Talk like a man

790
00:59:58,148 --> 00:59:59,230
coward

791
00:59:59,861 --> 01:00:00,861
where are you

792
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:08,080
Luo

793
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:09,451
I admit

794
01:00:09,582 --> 01:00:11,455
I have always admired you

795
01:00:12,045 --> 01:00:13,497
Why not work together

796
01:00:15,459 --> 01:00:16,459
I found them

797
01:00:17,091 --> 01:00:18,253
Behind that broken wall

798
01:00:27,394 --> 01:00:28,645
time up

799
01:00:50,421 --> 01:00:51,421
This wall

800
01:00:52,043 --> 01:00:53,966
This wall will be blown up soon

801
01:00:54,176 --> 01:00:55,007
We're done

802
01:00:55,007 --> 01:00:56,007
There is still drama

803
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:58,391
Buddy, come to the black cat game

804
01:00:59,012 --> 01:01:00,012
That's too dangerous

805
01:01:03,808 --> 01:01:05,059
I am black cat

806
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,112
Nine Lives

807
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:17,512
When I was in the Spetsnaz Special Forces

808
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:20,418
How many people did i kill

809
01:01:20,788 --> 01:01:22,210
You can't imagine

810
01:01:25,884 --> 01:01:28,387
Today you can die by your own gun

811
01:01:28,838 --> 01:01:30,970
Three two one

812
01:01:31,391 --> 01:01:32,391
action

813
01:01:52,706 --> 01:01:53,706
aged

814
01:01:53,958 --> 01:01:54,579
Can you resist

815
01:01:54,959 --> 01:01:55,959
You go

816
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:57,671
Too dangerous

817
01:01:57,793 --> 01:01:58,624
come back

818
01:01:58,794 --> 01:01:59,794
Do not

819
01:02:01,297 --> 01:02:03,299
Let me be your wingman for the last time

820
01:02:04,511 --> 01:02:05,262
I'm blocking you

821
01:02:05,342 --> 01:02:06,433
Don't die

822
01:02:07,384 --> 01:02:08,384
Don't hesitate

823
01:02:14,312 --> 01:02:15,312
I'm blocking

824
01:02:16,645 --> 01:02:17,526
fast

825
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:18,526
I'm blocking

826
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:21,860
I guess

827
01:02:22,703 --> 01:02:23,703
this is mine

828
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:26,117
The Ninth Life

829
01:03:04,543 --> 01:03:05,754
what

830
01:03:06,295 --> 01:03:08,257
I must take your skin off

831
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,131
What the hell is this

832
01:03:13,384 --> 01:03:15,716
Kim didn't die

833
01:04:15,749 --> 01:04:16,749
gold

834
01:04:18,592 --> 01:04:20,004
You know i never like you

835
01:04:22,887 --> 01:04:25,010
I just think

836
01:04:26,602 --> 01:04:27,683
Give high

837
01:04:29,726 --> 01:04:30,937
Revenge with Mike

838
01:04:31,728 --> 01:04:33,360
We should have a winner

839
01:04:35,192 --> 01:04:36,864
If we can all survive

840
01:04:37,445 --> 01:04:39,527
I'll fuck you up

841
01:04:40,739 --> 01:04:41,739
Hard work

842
01:04:42,741 --> 01:04:43,742
Wait and see

843
01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:50,040
Anytime

844
01:05:01,143 --> 01:05:03,904
The government forces and the bandits
are still in a state of anxiety

845
01:05:04,397 --> 01:05:05,849
Without any reinforcements

846
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,312
We have to rely on ourselves

847
01:05:16,862 --> 01:05:19,062
They will transport Agent
Orange weapons to the airport

848
01:05:19,205 --> 01:05:20,827
We want to intercept them halfway

849
01:05:41,943 --> 01:05:43,484
This is a suicide mission

850
01:05:44,275 --> 01:05:45,275
Unpaid

851
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:47,149
No reputation

852
01:06:09,175 --> 01:06:09,806
They are coming soon

853
01:06:10,056 --> 01:06:11,056
are you ready

854
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:14,310
I'm ready

855
01:06:15,102 --> 01:06:16,274
Listen to the tone

856
01:06:16,684 --> 01:06:18,106
You don't seem to be scared at all

857
01:06:19,528 --> 01:06:21,046
I went to save hundreds
of thousands of people

858
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:22,070
What am i afraid of

859
01:06:23,443 --> 01:06:25,003
You should nominate for the Peace Prize

860
01:06:27,497 --> 01:06:28,497
gold

861
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:30,541
Hope to have a chance

862
01:06:31,662 --> 01:06:32,794
Fight with you again

863
01:06:33,374 --> 01:06:35,167
Goodbye

864
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:39,170
They are coming

865
01:06:39,302 --> 01:06:39,962
Three cars

866
01:06:40,053 --> 01:06:41,453
Pickup guards at the front and rear

867
01:06:41,554 --> 01:06:42,845
The truck in the middle is our goal

868
01:06:42,846 --> 01:06:43,887
Give me data

869
01:06:47,061 --> 01:06:48,142
There are 1.6 kilometers to

870
01:06:49,724 --> 01:06:50,724
locking

871
01:06:51,146 --> 01:06:52,146
Ready to go

872
01:06:56,032 --> 01:06:57,032
near-point

873
01:06:58,575 --> 01:06:59,696
Closer

874
01:07:14,424 --> 01:07:15,424
Fried

875
01:08:01,441 --> 01:08:02,441
I was found

876
01:08:02,772 --> 01:08:03,772
Need to change place

877
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:43,860
They came out to find you

878
01:09:08,191 --> 01:09:08,561
gold

879
01:09:08,692 --> 01:09:09,692
it's your turn

880
01:09:27,374 --> 01:09:29,296
Go to death

881
01:09:54,617 --> 01:09:55,618
We were cheated

882
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:57,500
Truck is empty

883
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:06,511
note

884
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:07,552
Another car is coming

885
01:10:07,673 --> 01:10:08,673
The situation is wrong

886
01:10:28,908 --> 01:10:29,449
gold

887
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:30,579
Leave there soon

888
01:10:53,648 --> 01:10:54,648
gold

889
01:10:56,612 --> 01:10:58,274
I'm not stupid

890
01:11:37,531 --> 01:11:38,531
Operation Gray

891
01:12:08,989 --> 01:12:10,280
Baby

892
01:12:12,663 --> 01:12:13,825
We meet again

893
01:12:14,706 --> 01:12:16,578
I don't think you dare to shoot

894
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,420
Shoot

895
01:12:21,294 --> 01:12:22,375
Come and shoot me

896
01:12:23,176 --> 01:12:24,176
Shoot

897
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,720
Do not be afraid

898
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:28,883
I will be very gentle

899
01:12:28,973 --> 01:12:31,555
look

900
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:32,556
I will love you well

901
01:12:39,485 --> 01:12:40,485
Hurry up

902
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,295
The boss is still waiting for Agent Orange

903
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:43,781
I'll get him

904
01:12:53,122 --> 01:12:54,122
Lucy

905
01:12:54,584 --> 01:12:55,944
Can't let the car leave the valley

906
01:12:56,586 --> 01:12:57,586
Quickly fry

907
01:13:01,342 --> 01:13:01,842
Lucy

908
01:13:02,223 --> 01:13:03,223
Lucy

909
01:13:40,809 --> 01:13:42,101
My M14

910
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:43,523
Twenty bullets

911
01:13:44,434 --> 01:13:45,725
-two three four

912
01:13:46,356 --> 01:13:47,756
There should be only one serve left

913
01:14:00,453 --> 01:14:01,584
Last shot

914
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:03,126
Last shot

915
01:14:15,141 --> 01:14:16,352
happy New Year

916
01:14:30,990 --> 01:14:33,833
You remind me of my passion

917
01:15:20,299 --> 01:15:22,342
Injured rabbit and hunter

918
01:15:22,472 --> 01:15:23,472
interesting

919
01:15:30,191 --> 01:15:31,191
calm

920
01:15:31,352 --> 01:15:32,352
Ling Jing

921
01:15:33,355 --> 01:15:34,355
calm

922
01:15:35,908 --> 01:15:36,908
calm

923
01:15:40,363 --> 01:15:41,363
Clam West

924
01:15:41,415 --> 01:15:41,955
fast

925
01:15:42,165 --> 01:15:43,165
Plan B

926
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:56,052
You are not a sniper at all

927
01:15:58,305 --> 01:15:59,556
Victory or defeat

928
01:16:00,187 --> 01:16:02,140
It's not made of impulse and blood

929
01:16:08,197 --> 01:16:09,989
Mainly patience and suffering

930
01:16:28,471 --> 01:16:30,223
What the hell is going on

931
01:17:16,029 --> 01:17:17,829
The government forces
will arrive in 12 hours

932
01:17:20,734 --> 01:17:21,734
What are you thinking

933
01:17:24,699 --> 01:17:25,699
I'm thinking

934
01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:31,838
What would it look like if there
were no conflicts in this world

935
01:17:35,882 --> 01:17:37,384
abstract

936
01:17:40,007 --> 01:17:41,059
Not too possible

937
01:17:45,013 --> 01:17:47,647
At least we prevented an impending conflict

938
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:50,941
Now is the time for no conflict

939
01:17:55,696 --> 01:17:57,448
I hope this time

940
01:18:00,162 --> 01:18:01,533
Can be longer

941
01:18:04,747 --> 01:18:05,959
Longer

942
01:18:12,887 --> 01:18:14,599
I found you serious

943
01:18:14,889 --> 01:18:16,932
Not as annoying as before

944
01:18:18,644 --> 01:18:21,187
Did i hate it before

945
01:18:22,058 --> 01:18:23,059
I told you

946
01:18:23,229 --> 01:18:24,229
I

947
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,473
My story is over

948
01:18:52,475 --> 01:18:53,686
It may not be perfect

949
01:18:54,557 --> 01:18:56,189
But I want to pass this story

950
01:18:57,481 --> 01:18:58,902
Convey my heart

951
01:19:00,234 --> 01:19:01,736
Hope for human conflict

952
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:07,032
Only happens in the virtual world
