00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,250
Take it.

180
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,791
There's a lot of real life in this book.

181
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:32,916
It'll help you.

182
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,208
- Thanks.
- [Carlo] Sure.

183
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,458
- [Sofia] Ciao.
- Ciao.

184
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,916
[alternative music playing]

185
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,625
[keys jangling]

186
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,291
[shower running]

187
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,541
I'm home!

188
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,416
[Margherita] Sweetie, is that you?

189
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,333
Uh, depends who's asking.

190
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,791
[Margherita chuckles]
I didn't hear you come in.

191
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,583
Can you bring me a towel?

192
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:33,750
Oh shit.

193
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,083
- Carlo!
- Yeah, yeah. I know. I know.

194
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,583
- [Margherita] It's broken.
- [Carlo] Everything's broken.

195
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,250
But if you were a bit gentler
with things, you'd see that...

196
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,166
[grunts]

197
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,750
...the door opens, and you can get out.

198
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,875
- You have magic hands.
- Yeah. I do.

199
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:48,791
[piano music playing]

200
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,267
So how'd it go at physical therapy?
Did he manage to fix you?

201
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,416
[scoffs]

202
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,000
There was a new guy today, you know?

203
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,416
Daniele has tendinitis. Ironic. Right?

204
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,041
And how is he? How's the new guy?

205
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,083
Well, he's hot!

206
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,083
- Oh, he's hot?
- Hmm.

207
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,500
Hotter than your client from this morning?

208
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,416
[both chuckle]

209
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:16,500
Actually, I would need just a few more
details before I made my offer.

210
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,750
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

211
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,500
So you want another appointment?

212
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,041
Maybe.

213
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,416
[both chuckle]

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,958
Who knows how much
a house like that costs.

215
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,541
Hmm. A lot.

216
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,250
How much is it?

217
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,083
Uh, way too much for us.

218
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,791
- Really?
- Hmm.

219
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,291
Yep.

220
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,500
But do you really like it that much?

221
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,500
Sweetie, I see ten houses a day.

222
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:41,125
This one is...
It's special. It's got character.

223
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,166
[inhales, sighs]

224
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,375
What did you do today?

225
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,875
[inhales sharply] I graded
lots of tests and assignments.

226
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,438
- Did you get to do any writing?
- No.

227
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,208
Well, I'm waiting for your second novel.

228
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,708
I can't wait to read it.

229
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,684
- Did you order the pizza?
- Yep. It'll be here in ten minutes.

230
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,958
- Get in the shower.
- Okay.

231
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,333
[contemplative music playing]

232
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,291
[exhales]

234
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,416
[sighs heavily]

235
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,416
ONE MAN, ONE WOMAN
BY CARLO PENTECOSTE

236
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,875
IN THAT MOMENT, HE REALIZED THAT

237
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,875
[sighs]

238
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,250
- Who is it?
- Me.

239
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,916
- [woman] <i>"Me," who?</i>
- Your daughter.

240
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,083
Oh.

241
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,166
[door buzzes]

242
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,125
- Come on.
- [Margherita] Hey!

243
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,291
- You there?
- [woman] I'm here.

244
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,875
- How's it going?
- [Margherita] Great. You?

245
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,708
[scoffs] I dreamed about Pannella.

246
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,333
Oh. So?

247
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,625
Every time I dream about him,
something bad happens.

248
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:42,041
- Are you and Carlo okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Nothing bad's happened to us.

249
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,750
Okay. That's better.

250
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,250
So, why don't you tell me.
This one or this one?

251
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,666
Mom, come on. We're late.

252
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,601
You know how nervous Carlo gets
when we visit his parents. We need to go.

253
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:54,041
- Come on! Tell me. This, or this?
- I don't know. Gray. It's more elegant.

254
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,791
Gray, more elegant? [scoffs]

255
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,375
Okay. Let's go. Come on!

256
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,791
- Oh. The gift, the gift, the gift!
- Oh. The gift.

257
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:04,916
The gift.

258
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,041
[parking brake activates]

259
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,500
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello.

260
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,625
[Carlo] Happy birthday.

261
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,125
[chuckles] Thank you.

262
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,500
Happy birthday, Loretta. You look great.

263
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,375
Aww. Thanks, honey.
You are as beautiful as ever.

264
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,958
- Happy birthday.
- [Loretta] Anna.

265
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,125
Thank you.

266
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,333
- [Anna] This is for you.
- Oh. Thanks.

267
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,458
[chuckles lightly]

268
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,666
Is it a scarf?

269
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,958
[Anna] Yes. Do you like it?

270
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,583
Uh, yes. It's very interesting.

271
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,750
So you knit now?

272
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,750
Yes, maybe.
It's a little eccentric for you,

273
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:50,125
but, well, come on, it's fun
to be a little crazy sometimes. Right?

274
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,250
You're 60 after all.

275
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,541
Uh-huh. Yeah. Sure.

276
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,708
Great. Let's go inside.

277
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,916
Your father's
already waiting at the table.

278
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,583

[silverware clattering]

280
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,875
[Loretta] So, Margherita,
how's the physiotherapy?

281
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,041
- It's not getting better, unfortunately.
- Hmm.

282
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,708
Once it's fall, uh,
it just gets really humid,

283
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,166
so the pain comes back.

284
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,250
Wait. It was Carlo's fault wasn't it?

285
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,375
[Carlo] My fault?

286
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,125
My fault it gets humid?

287
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,416
[chuckles]

288
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,958
Actually, I got hurt
when I followed him a few years ago.

289
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,666
But what's a little pain in comparison
to a lifetime of happiness, you know?

290
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,333
- You married him, after all.
- [scoffs]

291
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,583
Even though artists are a risky deal.

292
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:34,791
[cell phone chimes]

293
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,166
SOFIA
TOMORROW?

294
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,250
Who is it?

295
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,583
Nothing. Just work.

296
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,833
CARLO
SURE

297
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,625
[father] Your writing course?

298
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,541
Yeah.

299
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:46,833
SOFIA
USUAL PLACE?

300
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,083
[Loretta] And the sales.
How are the sales going?

301
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,166
CARLO
ALL RIGHT

302
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,875
Well, the market's in crisis,
but we're pulling through.

303
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,375
I recently took on a beautiful house.

304
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,000
Hmm. Where?

305
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,250
In Concordia.

306
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,083
Oh. It's a great deal too.

307
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,125
Well, it could be an opportunity for you.

308
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,750
It's not that low.
It's still too much for us. [chuckles]

309
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:09,000
[father] We can help you,
like we did with your sister.

310
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,666
It's time to grow up.

311
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,375
You can't live
in a one-bedroom apartment all your life.

312
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,208
What matters
is that you're happy there. Right?

313
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,333
Margherita, are you happy there?

314
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,125
It's not the right time
to think about moving.

315
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,333
Uh, Carlo's working on a new novel.

316
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,833
The last one was four years ago.

317
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,059
[Carlo inhales] Why not talk
about something important?

318
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,791
Like, how many lives
have you saved this week, Pop?

319
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,750
[chuckles]

320
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,559
[Margherita] Anyway, I read
what he's written so far, and...

321
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,583
and it's amazing.

322
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,833
It's the best thing Carlo's ever written.

323
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,041
What do you say we order something
and then maybe watch a movie?

324
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,791
Yeah. Sounds good. But I'll cook.

325
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,791
- Thanks.
- What for?

326
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
For saying those things about my novel.

327
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,750
I know you'll never let me read it
until you're finished,

328
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,583
but I'm sure it's beautiful.

329
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,666
You just need the right push
so you finish it.

330
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,041
Listen. Do you have class tomorrow?

331
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,381
'Cause I have some time
between appointments...

332
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,833
Listen. About that couple

333
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,791
at the Concordia house.

334
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,750
- Have they made an offer yet?
- No.

335
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,083
You think they will?

336
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,291
I don't know.
You saw how they were all... Mmm.

337
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,416
[both chuckle]

338
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,583
What if we made an offer?

339
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:37,666
[romantic music playing]

340
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,708
No. I don't want you to say yes
to your dad just to make me happy.

341
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,125
We've always managed on our own.

342
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,291
Who said I was gonna ask my dad for money?

343
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,320
Well, how would you do it though?

344
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,000
With the book.

345
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,416
[scoffs] You need
to finish writing it first.

346
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
It's like you said.

347
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,750
I just need a push,
and maybe the push is this house.

348
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,500
[exhales]

349
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,125
Yeah. I know it's a gamble

350
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,083
and I'm probably gonna
fuck it all up, but...

351
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,666
Just imagine us living there.

352
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,291
All that light.
You could decorate it how you want.

353
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,375
No more broken showers.

354
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,434
Even if that couple doesn't make an offer,
there will be others.

355
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,250
- A studio! A studio just for me.
- There will be others.

356
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,625
A room for our kids to grow up in,

357
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,833
when we do decide to have kids.

358
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,833
[both chuckle]

359
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,125
[Carlo giggles]

360
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,375
You need to find out
what's blocking you, Sofia.

361
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,041
Maybe you just need
to find the right story to tell?

362
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,708
[indistinct chatter]

363
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,096
I don't know.
Maybe you haven't figured out

364
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,208
the day that turned your life around yet.

365
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,708
[girl] Oh no!

366
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,208
So tell me, what was yours?

367
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,250
It was a day
in late September, five years ago.

368
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,875
I was on my bike.

369
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,125
Didn't have a permanent job yet.

370
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,083
I was still working on my first novel,
and I was feeling stuck.

371
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:23,125
And I had just recently met the woman
who would become my future wife.

372
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,875
But I hadn't yet gotten married.

373
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,625
Everything was still possible.

374
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,958
- That's very nice.
- Hmm.

375
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,541
Is yours nice too?

376
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,666
[contemplative music playing]

377
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,333
Look. If talking about this
makes you uncomfortable,

378
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,250
I could just assign you a different task.

379
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,500
But you don't want that.
You know what story you wanna tell.

380
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,166
You're just trying to find the courage
to tell it. Isn't that right?

381
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,083
All right, then. I'll try.

382
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,500
Awesome.

383
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,083
But on one condition.

384
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,666
If you get to read mine, I can read yours.

385
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,125
No, no, no.

386
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,125
No. I never let people
read my work. No one.

387
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,791
Make an exception for me.

388
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,583
Hmm. Mm-mm.

389
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,000
I have to write
about something very personal.

390
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,416
I just wanna know
if I'm able to trust you.

391
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:18,916
Okay.

392
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,375
I'll think about it.

393
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,958
You start though.

394
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Mm-hmm.

395
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,583
[sniffles]

396
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,583
I... I've changed my mind.

397
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,958
I'm going home and...
and I'll look at it again later tonight.

398
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,741
So, I guess we're done. Right?

399
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,291
I suppose we are. You're dismissed.

400
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,333
Ciao.

401
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,375
Ciao.

402
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,166
[exhales]

403
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,583
Hey. Where are you headed?

404
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,041
I could drive you.

405
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,166
Sure.

406
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,208
Thanks.

407
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,333
Right over there.

408
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,166
[Margherita] Yeah.
It's a bit crazy, but we wanna try it.

409
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:09,333
The house is so special, Mom.
Really. You have to see it to believe it.

410
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,291
Okay. Sounds good.

411
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,458
Okay. I have to hang up.

412
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,541
Ciao.

413
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,500
- Hi, Eva!
- [Eva] Hey, Marghe.

414
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:22,375
Listen. How did the visit go on Friday
at the house in Concordia?

415
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,250
There was another
prospective buyer, right?

416
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,958
A certain Carlo something, huh?

417
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,791
Carlo Pentecoste, I believe.

418
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,291
Thanks for giving him the address.

419
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,916
I think he's really considering
the apartment too.

420
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,333
[door opens]

421
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,458
- Good morning.
- [Eva] Morning!

422
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,541
[man] Hello.

423
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
[door closes]

424
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,291
Please, have a seat.

425
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,666
- [woman] Thanks.
- [man] Thanks.

426
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:48,125
So, I suppose
you wanna consider other offers.

427
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,125
It seemed
that the last option didn't convince you.

428
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,833
[man] Not at all.

429
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:53,833
We want it.

430
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,291
[dramatic music playing]

431
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,208
Oh. Great.

432
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,726
Yeah. We're already thinking
about what work needs to be done.

433
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,958
We wanna knock down some, um... some walls.

434
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,041
The blueprint allows for it. Doesn't it?

435
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,416
Sorry, but why?

436
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,125
To have a bigger living room.

437
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:10,666
Of course. It's just that the living room
is already 60 square meters.

438
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,791
And these things
require special permission, and, uh...

439
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,916
Yeah. My cousin is a local surveyor.
We'll get the permits.

440
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,833
Can we please just move on to the deal?

441
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,541
- Of course.
- [man] Thanks.

442
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:24,458
Oh. And, by the way,
we're offering 20% below the asking price.

443
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,500
Well, that sounds
a bit too low, I'm afraid.

444
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,291
Just between us, uh,

445
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,958
we're gonna buy it anyway,

446
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,583
even if the owner
refuses a price adjustment.

447
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,666
Luckily, we're not short
on cash. [chuckles]

448
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,625
Great.

449
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,541
[dramatic music playing]

450
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,125
Thanks so much for the ride.

451
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,083
It was nothing.

452
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,125
See you.

453
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,791
Yeah. I'll see you at school.

454
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,625
I enjoyed talking to you today.

455
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,125
That's good.

456
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:08,541
- [Sofia] Ciao.
- Ciao.

457
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:13,916
[door closes]

458
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,333
[car engine starting]

459
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,791
Well, they're my latest purchase.
I love them! They're awesome.

460
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,333
[woman] They're... they're gorgeous!

461
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,125
Look at that, huh? [chuckles]

462
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,333
- Sisters?
- [woman chuckles]

463
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:02,500
Ah. Here he is.

464
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:03,875
[indistinct chatter]

465
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,583
- [man] Hey, man.
- [man 2] Oh.

466
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,666
Oh. Sorry. I'm so sorry I'm late.

467
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,310
- You're right. You're right.
- Darling.

468
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:13,333
I was just texting you. What happened?

469
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:15,250
Nothing. I... I had a private lesson

470
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,333
that went on
a little bit longer than I planned.

471
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:18,666
I'm exhausted.

472
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,750
- You don't look exhausted.
- You and your lessons.

473
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:24,059
Instead of getting other people to write,
you should be writing yourself. I mean...

474
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,750
Okay. Whose brilliant idea was it
to invite my editor?

475
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,166
- [girls in unison] Yours.
- Mine?

476
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,375
Shall we order, guys?

477
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,541
Let's have, um, the usual?

478
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,791
Well, Margherita, if you say it like that...

479
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,250
I said it because I like it so much!

480
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,458
- [man] I know!
- [woman] The wine is good. Okay?

481
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,666
[man] I've been dreaming
about it for years.

482
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,875
I even put up the postcard in the kitchen.

483
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:46,250
Good?

484
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:49,458
Malé Atoll, and, uh, now it'll come true.

485
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,416
- Hopefully.
- Hopefully.

486
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,125
- Awesome.
- Great! When are you going?

487
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,333
In two weeks, if he gets some time off.

488
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:55,791
- Yep. Yeah.
- The Maldives?

489
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:58,708
Mm-hmm. There are sharks,
thunderstorms, it's a terrible experience.

490
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,458
- No! Come on.
- What do you know?

491
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:01,941
When have you been to the Maldives?

492
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,666
Oh. Which lover did you take?

493
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,333
They're companions, not lovers.
Don't diminish them.

494
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,601
Actually, I don't... I don't remember.

495
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:09,791
When was I there?

496
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,250
Wait. Why are you looking at her?

497
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,559
- Oh my God. That's so...
- [man 2] I remember seeing you.

498
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:16,375
No, no, no! I... I never went
to the Maldives with you.

499
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,625
- No.
- [man 2] What a shame.

500
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,625
In other news, we're moving.

501
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,166
So you guys found a house?

502
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,083
- Well...
- Well... well...

503
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:27,041
It depends. It depends on the contract
that I close with my editor.

504
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,458
So what you're saying is,
there's a book finally?

505
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,000
You should start writing the check.

506
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,291
Should I expect
to be reading something finished soon?

507
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,583
You need to get in line.

508
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:37,500
I'm sorry, but he got stuck
halfway through the first novel.

509
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,458
Then we met,
and he finished it in two weeks.

510
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:43,250
So, I most definitely earned
the role of being his first reader.

511
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,125
- Have I not?
- [man 2 in Italian] <i>Ubi maior.</i>

512
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,833
Well, my role
is to put the pressure on. [chuckles]

513
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,708
Boy. Listen. I have no doubt you will.

514
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:50,958
[woman] Yeah, yeah.

515
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:53,125
- Let's make a toast.
- [man] Okay.

516
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,750
To new beaches, new houses,

517
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:57,500
and new books. Yeah? Yeah, yeah.

518
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,041
- Yeah, yeah.
- [man 2] Yeah.

519
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,291
And also to our beauty.

520
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,791
- [chuckles]
- [Carlo] Cheers, guys.

521
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,541
- [woman] Cheers.
- [man] Cheers!

522
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:10,041
Listen, Concordia...

523
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,541
- I think we're gonna lose it.
- Why?

524
