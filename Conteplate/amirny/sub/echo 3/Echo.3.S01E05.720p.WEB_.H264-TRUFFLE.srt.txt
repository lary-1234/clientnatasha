1
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,055
Sophie.

2
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,314
Jairo, what's up, man?

3
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:49,443
Hey, Maria Eugenia!

4
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,569
Hello, Javier, how are you?

5
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,279
- I saw your husband with another woman.
- Ah.

6
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,405
Watch out.

7
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,032
Javier, how are you?

8
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,617
Look what I brought you.

9
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,036
Let's see, what do you have in there?

10
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,288
Well, look at this beauty.

11
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,165
That's a good looking fish.

12
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,578
Enjoy.

13
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,909
So much meat and me on a diet.

14
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,869
Quit teasing, girls.

15
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,091
You taking care of her?

16
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:19,760
She looks horrible.

17
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:29,811
It's okay.

18
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:32,940
Apologies.

19
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,317
I meant to be here
when you first arrived.

20
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,735
I came as soon as I could.

21
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,284
Called payara.

22
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,497
Ugly, but it's delicious.

23
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,541
And the locals know how to make it.

24
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,419
Anyway.

25
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,046
I'm Tommy.

26
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,133
I'm Venezuelan, obviously, but I
was educated in the US. Georgetown.

27
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,637
Do you know if...

28
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,058
Do you know if my husband is alive?

29
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,147
Good question. And feel free
to ask me anything you want.

30
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:16,900
Okay?

31
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,577
But about that, I don't know.

32
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,246
Should eat. It's always good advice.

33
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,169
How long will I be here?

34
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,212
I don't know.

35
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,380
Different department.

36
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,760
Sorry, I'm just a bureaucrat
with limited vision.

37
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:44,928
Not a very glamorous job.

38
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,182
But you?

39
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,684
One of your employers is the CIA.

40
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,644
- No.
- No?

41
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,193
It's a mistake, this file?

42
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,694
If that's what it says, yeah.

43
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,741
Well, I can't change
what the file says, but...

44
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,954
I can write a new file that goes on top,
becomes the current file.

45
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,459
So, tell me about yourself.

46
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,548
I'm a scientist.

47
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,133
Peer-reviewed.

48
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,469
You can look it up online.

49
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:32,059
And I was picked up collecting
plant samples to study tribal medicine.

50
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,477
I do addiction research.

51
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:40,025
And there was a giant mix-up
over the fact that I had a GPS beacon

52
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,276
in my stuff.

53
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,655
Not any GPS beacon. Army issued.

54
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,240
Right.

55
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,077
My husband's in the military.
So is my brother.

56
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,499
I mean, you should see our house.
It's like a fucking armory.

57
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,919
Well, you know, Amber, to be fair,

58
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,589
there was a great deal
of hardware unleashed to save someone.

59
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:07,344
And don't take offense,
someone who's only a scientist.

60
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,054
No.

61
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,098
You're conflating facts.

62
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,307
Please.

63
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:15,185
My brother is like a legend
in Special Forces.

64
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,604
My husband's very fucking powerful.

65
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,316
So, they have the means
and the resources to mount a rescue.

66
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:23,902
That's not a bad thing.

67
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,822
Is it... Is it bad that they love me?

68
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,156
No.

69
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,911
No, but the other view would be
that your family members

70
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:36,748
with the security clearances
make you very trustworthy.

71
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:43,255
So, your family loves you, sure,
but the CIA could love you too, no?

72
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,264
I have friends at Langley,
believe it or not, from my college days.

73
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,308
I know how it works.

74
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,103
I used to be a writer.

75
00:07:58,896 --> 00:07:59,938
I was pretty good.

76
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,149
Then I went into national security,

77
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,318
and for a while there,
I was actually doing both.

78
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:08,322
Writing fiction during the week and
gathering intelligence on the weekend.

79
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,741
Just like you. Two lives.

80
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,870
So, I feel like I understand you.

81
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,497
Where is this going?

82
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:19,708
Honestly?

83
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,712
You'd probably die here.

84
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,175
I'm just checking boxes.

85
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,932
And now we're both just here,
in... in this scenario,

86
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,476
and I wanna have a good relationship
with you.

87
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,559
I want that too.

88
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,813
Good. Great.

89
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,315
Thank you.

90
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,652
There is no reason we cannot be friends.

91
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:55,285
I'll be back in two or three weeks
to take your statement.

92
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,580
Hey, Tomás, I have something else
really important to say to you, okay?

93
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,626
What is it?

94
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,589
Fuck you.

95
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,179
Oh, I love it. I really do.

96
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,306
You know,
a normal person would be terrified.

97
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,811
They'd... You'd be kissing my shoes,
but you're so composed.

98
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,106
You must have had
some great fucking training.

99
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,108
It's my childhood.

100
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,654
When I was little,
there was this rapist guy, right,

101
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,155
who was my mother's boyfriend.

102
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:37,744
And my brother,
who is probably gonna kill you...

103
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:43,792
Yeah, anyway, he-he shot this guy
when he was eight.

104
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,672
Just close range, with a hunting rifle,

105
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,382
right in front of my fucking face.

106
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:54,052
And I think that that event taught me
about fear.

107
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:58,098
And I acquired this immunity to sadists.

108
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,566
It's like she's still here with me.

109
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,818
I just can't believe it.

110
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:14,489
In one second, everything changed.

111
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:19,828
She should be here with us.

112
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:23,415
I let her down. I
didn't take care of her.

113
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:33,842
What's going on, Manuel?

114
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,093
- Hey.
- Hey.

115
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,929
- Ready to head out?
- Yes, boss.

116
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,181
- Give me a minute and I'll be right there.
- Okay.

117
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,523
Hello.

118
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,735
You're leaving so soon?

119
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,948
Gotta go to Caracas to report
on the good work being done here.

120
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,700
Especially by you.

121
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:02,579
Listen.

122
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:06,583
I want you to know
we are all very sorry about Fami.

123
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,130
- Thank you.
- So what?

124
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:13,966
Are you leaving?

125
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:14,967
Give it some time.

126
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,261
Stay. Relax.

127
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,514
Drink, eat, you deserve it.
And the fish is...

128
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:22,808
Okay.

129
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:23,976
You want to go to Colombia?

130
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,022
No, there's nothing for me there.

131
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,859
Then it's settled.

132
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,944
Take all the time you want, okay?

133
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,280
Hey?

134
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,531
- Yes?
- Okay.

135
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,949
All right, then.

136
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,033
Take care.

137
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,174
Put the American on the program.

138
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:56,842
- Will do.
- Keep an eye on her.

139
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:57,926
You know it, brother.

140
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,178
All right, then. Take care.

141
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,770
Down by the bay

142
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,648
Where the watermelons grow

143
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,276
Back to my home

144
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,111
I dare not go

145
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,738
For if I do

146
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,490
My mother will say

147
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,119
"Have you ever seen a bear
Combing his hair"...

148
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,098
You look like shit.

149
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:53,685
You should learn how to
dress up a little better.

150
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,437
I ate some bad fish.

151
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,232
But I'm ready to brief you.

152
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,525
Go on, then.

153
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,276
She's marvelous.

154
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,488
My idea is to produce videos with her.

155
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,740
Give a little love to the base.

156
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,909
Love to the base?

157
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,411
What the fuck are you talking about?

158
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:12,454
More YouTube?

159
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,957
Picture it,

160
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,751
"The damsel they cannot bring home."

161
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:21,338
It's perfect
because her family is military.

162
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:25,092
If I can get her to
disavow her own blood!

163
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,928
Wow! That shit goes viral.

164
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,806
Fuck.

165
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,182
It's a little obvious, no?

166
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,142
Obvious is good, no?

167
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,895
Makes it clear.

168
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,897
What's clear?

169
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:39,940
Fuck YouTube.

170
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:44,236
I asked you to find out what role
she plays in all this.

171
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:46,738
None.

172
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,159
Maybe she's a
subcontractor, I don't know.

173
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,997
You're losing it.

174
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,333
You're either full of shit, or I don't
know what the fuck is wrong with you.

175
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:03,088
You're coming up with this silly
YouTube video shit.

176
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:07,926
Fuck, how can I do my job
if you don't trust me?

177
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,971
You want me to trust you?
Take responsibility.

178
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,265
- Give it to me.
- Will you take responsibility?

179
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:16,101
Find that shit out, now.

180
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,854
What the fuck is her role in all this?

181
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,523
Get answers or I'm gonna fuck you!

182
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,234
Okay.

183
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:25,360
Okay, nothing.

184
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,905
Move your ass and get to work, fuck.

185
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:32,993
Done.

186
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,112
Get out of here.

187
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,327
I want to get out of here!

188
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,998
You better get out.

189
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,546
Out of here!

190
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,258
Don't come in here.

191
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:36,640
Do not come in here.
No, no, no. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

192
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,062
Hello?

193
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,147
Go away.

194
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,779
Go away.
You're not supposed to be in here.

195
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:52,739
Hello?

196
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,800
I'm Amber.

197
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,220
This is my room.

198
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,264
Won't you get out of here?

199
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,099
Okay.

200
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,271
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

201
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,320
What day is it?

202
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:32,404
I don't know.

203
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,866
- Are you trying to confuse me?
- Not at all.

204
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,535
I didn't know you were in here.

205
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,579
The door was unlocked.

206
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,165
- What day is it?
- I don't know.

207
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,376
I will not speak to you, in that case.

208
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,393
Are you German?

209
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,567
How long have you been here?

210
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:17,950
Is that a toothbrush?

211
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,369
You can't have it!

212
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:33,507
- The music is so loud.
- There's no music.

213
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,551
- The music is so loud. Too loud!
- There's no music.

214
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,094
- Hey, hey! Hey!
- Stop!

215
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:39,763
Listen.

216
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,809
They turned the music off. It's over.

217
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:50,816
There was...

218
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:54,987
There was no music.

219
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:58,574
So, I... Now I know you're a liar.

220
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,704
Thank you very much.

221
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:08,333
Liar.

222
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:09,728
I would like
to know how 500 million points

223
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,272
of mega data got pushed in four weeks.

224
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:15,692
I don't know. I do not kn...

225
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:54,690
Amber, no. What are you doing, Amber?

226
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:58,026
No, no, no. What are you doing?

227
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,780
This is not right. Not like this.
You use your hamstrings.

228
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:04,616
I do it like this. You do it like this.

229
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:11,164
What is your problem?
Why you never talk to me?

230
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,376
I've tried. It's hard.

231
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:20,090
No, you don't. Not really.
You don't really talk to me.

232
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:22,676
Not from the heart.

233
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:27,431
Hey.

234
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:32,352
Have you ever been diagnosed
with schizophrenia?

235
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:37,691
You imagine things that aren't real,
like that music, the music playing.

236
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,694
Hallucinations are a feature
of schizophrenia.

237
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:49,369
Maybe if I'm crazy,
I shouldn't tell you that I'm leaving.

238
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,455
I'm leaving in November.
It's been decided.

239
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:55,709
And, if you want me to,

240
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:58,587
I can maybe call your family,
let them know you're here.

241
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,677
You're very fortunate to have me.

242
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,387
Can I ask you a question?

243
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,014
Ja.

244
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:14,853
Why do you get to move around
wherever you want all by yourself?

245
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,314
They let you go anywhere.

246
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,983
- I earn it.
- How?

247
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,027
They love free labor.

248
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,989
If I earn five minutes by myself...

249
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,368
swim across.

250
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:34,164
You can't escape from here. Never.

251
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:43,298
You want a tip though?
Don't drink the soup. It's poisoned.

252
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:45,884
The soup?

253
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,469
Yeah.

254
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:40,397
Uh-huh.

255
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:29,112
Do you have a family?

256
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:30,531
Sí.

257
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:38,997
I got Amber!

258
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:48,924
Alex!

259
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:03,856
Just wanted to say thank you.

260
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:07,901
Will you take this? It's just a gift.

261
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:17,619
Adios, chicas.

262
00:26:44,563 --> 00:26:45,689
Thank you.

263
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:48,400
That's not the way to get... Escape.

264
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:49,943
You know a better one?

265
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:55,407
Yeah, I do. But I can't
tell you. They will kill me immediately.

266
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,911
- Don't you wanna get out?
- Yeah, I am.

267
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:00,412
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

268
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,122
- I am!
- The only way out is with me.

269
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:03,665
It's with me.

270
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:18,430
Look.

271
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:22,768
Okay.

272
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:44,790
Careful. Careful.

273
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:51,839
I thought you said it was poisoned.

274
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:57,094
It is. Nasty drugs.
Who cares? I'm leaving.

275
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,178
Might as well enjoy.

276
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:02,599
May I have yours?

277
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:03,851
No.

278
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:08,689
It's not poisoned. You want my soup.

279
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:14,820
Nein. Amber, w... was?

280
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:20,367
I got you.

281
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,661
I got your number.

282
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:33,046
It means,

283
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:38,051
"When you see the gold,
you've found El Dorado."

284
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:40,220
Let's talk about something that's real.

285
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:43,015
It's real. It's all around us.

286
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,310
Hey.

287
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,899
Nice to see you. You look nice.

288
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:19,820
Look, I have... I have a new theory.

289
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,989
And I... I think it's pretty good.

290
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:25,492
Our partners from Russia
and Cuba pulled your travel.

291
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:27,494
I asked them for help...

292
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:30,080
...with you because they
have advanced capabilities...

293
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:31,331
I like to travel.

294
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:36,628
And they have you
at Kleiner Tiergarten Park.

295
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:42,801
In Berlin, August 25th, 2019.

296
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:44,011
What?

297
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:45,804
Two days before you arrived there,

298
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:50,267
a Chechen separatist got killed
by a suppressed Glock 26.

299
00:30:58,442 --> 00:30:59,943
You think I killed him.

300
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:02,863
Of course you didn't kill him, Amber.

301
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:07,034
The FSB killed him.
You were sent in to map the scene.

302
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:11,955
- And that's you, first in.
- I was just a tourist.

303
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:16,376
There was probably
10,000 tourists there that day.

304
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,587
And that's what you were doing
at the border.

305
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,049
You were mapping our network,
assessing our ties to the villages.

306
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:26,261
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Tommy. Timmy?

307
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:27,554
Or is it Tomás?

308
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:33,519
Look, I'm your prisoner.
I'll say anything you want.

309
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:36,647
You can make me say anything you want,
so cut out all this bullshit.

310
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,732
- Let's do our tape.
- Okay, okay.

311
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:44,363
I'm just clearing up the air.
Just giving you my news.

312
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:47,950
So talk about the School of Americas,

313
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,244
all the assassination bullshit,

314
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:55,457
and whatever new piece you were
setting up in Venezuela.

315
00:31:57,417 --> 00:32:00,546
And look at me.
Look at me, not the camera.

316
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,553
Tell us why you are here.

317
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:10,556
My name is Amber Chesborough.

318
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:13,517
I'm a botanist and a pharmacologist,

319
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:16,103
and I'm being held
as a prisoner in Venezuela

320
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:18,856
because they think
that I'm part of the CIA.

321
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:22,150
Are you fucking with me right now?

322
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:27,406
Sorry, I just had to get that out there.

323
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:30,242
Oh, my God. Okay.

324
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,580
Just explain to me
the School of Americas thing.

325
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:38,083
Like, what e... what exactly it is,
and if it's related to cocaine,

326
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,210
'cause I wanna say it right.

327
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,004
I'm sorry. I don't know.

328
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:44,047
I don't know what the CIA
does around here,

329
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:47,509
and you fucking know that,
you sadistic bastard.

330
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:59,229
Amber, I'm t-trying to help you.

331
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:02,608
This is how you and I survive.

332
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,443
Okay, then just tell me what to say.

333
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:06,236
- It doesn't work that...
- Tell me what to say. Give me the line.

334
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,031
It doesn't work that way, okay?

335
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:19,124
My name is Amber Chesborough.

336
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,377
The daughter of Maggie, an artist.

337
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:26,173
The sister of Alex, a decorated soldier.

338
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:30,427
And the wife of Eric Haas,
a decorated soldier.

339
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:35,891
And I'm being held
against my will in Venezuela.

340
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:39,436
Unreal.

341
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,232
I surprised you, huh? Huh?

342
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:51,615
You came to this region to hurt people.
Admit that much.

343
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:54,576
To punish us until we become like you.

344
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:59,456
But the truth is that democracy
is dead in North America,

345
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,083
and we don't want to imitate you.

346
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:04,419
We reject your influence.

347
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:07,756
Oh, so what,
you fucking corrupt little baby?

348
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,926
But don't get like that, Amber.
I'm talking about the old you.

349
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,929
- Now you've changed.
- No, I'm completely the same.

350
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:15,639
- Oh, no, Amber.
- Yeah. Yeah, I am.

351
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,014
Amber, I've seen you.

352
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:22,521
Now you're making friends here, huh?
Like the people in the cocaine lab.

353
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:26,525
America should no longer treat Venezuela

354
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:31,487
as the enemy any more
than we treat ourselves as the enemy.

355
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:36,577
We're all human beings, and we
deserve equal treatment under God.

356
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:41,623
We have one good one.
I need ten more like.

357
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:46,170
America has done awful things
to Venezuela over the years.

358
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:48,839
- Our leaders are flawed. They're capable...
- Okay, that's... that's good. Good.

359
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:51,049
- Yeah, okay.
- It's generic.

360
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,551
You don't want to talk about the CIA.

361
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:57,848
It's okay. Fine. So what?

362
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:02,060
Now we're making a
propaganda tape, okay?

363
00:35:02,144 --> 00:35:04,980
So you don't have to believe it.
It's make-believe.

364
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:07,399
It's for the TV. It's for the Internet.

365
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:10,235
If my brother sees me trashing the US...

366
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:14,781
He will understand.
He's... He's not naive.

367
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:17,868
He has risked his life for this country.

368
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:19,453
- Let's move on.
- I just...

369
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:24,249
- I can't do it to him.
- Amber, let me make this easy for you.

370
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,627
I will move you to the men's prison.

371
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:34,009
This is the last time
I'm gonna hit record.

372
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:49,399
My name is Amber Chesborough...

373
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:56,156
and I'd like to make a statement
about America.

374
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:03,455
The people that I know

375
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:08,085
who work for the American government...

376
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:14,508
believe that they can make
the world a better place.

377
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:19,805
That's America.

378
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:28,021
This childish idea
that is worth dying for...

379
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:31,859
...that we can make
the world a better place.

380
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:39,867
Despite perhaps the
most obvious evidence.

381
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:53,255
I'm going to grab some air.

382
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:56,842
When I come back,
we're gonna do it again.

383
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:47,100
I'm not allowed more
than three pumps of soap.

384
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,771
I fake most of my orgasms.

385
00:37:51,313 --> 00:37:54,358
I want to rip out
the cat's whiskers sometimes.

386
00:37:57,069 --> 00:38:01,198
I have been having
super psychotic dreams.

387
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,702
I don't like the look of raisins.

388
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:11,750
I never knew my father.
He-he left when I was little.

389
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:14,419
And I heard from my brother
that he's a good dancer.

390
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:16,922
My father was wonderful.

391
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:20,259
My mother was the devil.
She prepared me for espionage.

392
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:24,763
My rich husband hates me.

393
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:27,015
He's so angry with me,

394
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:29,560
and that's why he's gonna leave me
in here to die.

395
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:32,479
That's absurd.

396
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:36,316
When I get out, I'll call them
and let them know you're here.

397
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,151
He's gonna come here immediately.

398
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,572
I can't hear God anymore.

399
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:43,949
I keep trying to remember
what he sounds like.

400
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:47,411
God sounds like flapping wings.
My husband hates me.

401
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,163
He's gonna leave me here because...

402
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:53,333
I lied to him.

403
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:58,630
I don't think your husband
would abandon someone so pretty.

404
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:01,091
You're so pretty.
Is that why he married you?

405
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:08,015
No. It was to prove something to himself,
that he wasn't his father, you know?

406
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:10,392
- But I shouldn't talk...
- But he kept you safe. He kept you safe.

407
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:12,060
But he looked down on me...

408
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:14,646
secretly.

409
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:20,152
If I'm honest...

410
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,531
I never loved him.

411
00:39:30,245 --> 00:39:32,581
Okay. I don't believe that.

412
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,462
I don't wanna play this anymore.

413
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:44,218
Oh, no, no. I'm not finished.
I'm not finished.

414
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,640
You refuse to believe
that the person you love lied to you.

415
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:51,600
It's too shocking a discovery,

416
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:54,478
so you cover the trauma
with rationalizations

417
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:56,230
that the whole marriage
was a kind of fraud.

418
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:57,231
But you loved him.

419
00:39:57,314 --> 00:40:00,359
No, I just said that I do not love him.
I just said that.

420
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:02,152
You're lying to yourself.

421
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:04,780
Forget about me,
but why is Amber lying to Amber?

422
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:09,618
No. I'm not taking therapy
from somebody who's mentally ill.

423
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:14,373
What if I am? So?

424
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,836
I'm still a lot smarter than you, Amber.

425
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:24,299
And I received training
at the BND in personality analysis.

426
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:28,303
It's a lot harder than studying plants.

427
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:00,460
I see you, my friend. I see you.

428
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:08,844
Hey. Did you sleep?

429
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:11,471
No.

430
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:13,891
Life is good. And the work's good.

431
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:14,975
Stay there.

432
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:17,686
Amberline, where would I go?

433
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:30,157
You said you had a plan to escape.
What is it?

434
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,284
What do I do? Like, where do I go?

435
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:36,246
Hey, they... they cannot understand you.
They don't speak any English.

436
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,999
Hey, Fabiola, do you speak English? No.

437
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:41,543
What about you, Maria?
Do you speak English? No.

438
00:41:41,627 --> 00:41:44,421
Pedro? No, no, no,
no, no, no. No English.

439
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:47,925
You can escape,
but you will have to kill someone.

440
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:51,178
And it's obvious to me, Amber,
that you're no killer.

441
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:55,057
That is the core problem, honestly.

442
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,809
That's what really worries me,
that you're no killer.

443
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:05,234
Hey. Hey. Tell me.

444
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:11,740
Behind the helicopter pad,
the guards leave an ATV.

445
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:16,078
They take it into the jungle,
not to... to patrol,

446
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:18,956
but to have sexual adventures.

447
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:23,752
So you take that ATV, and you-you
take it down the path to the waterfall.

448
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:28,257
And from there, to the river
that leads to the Amazon.

449
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,968
And then you follow
the current to civilization.

450
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:32,803
You understand?

451
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,763
Yeah. Yeah.

452
00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:39,434
You can't even kill a guard.
Why are we even talking about this?

453
00:42:39,518 --> 00:42:41,019
Oh, you'd be surprised.

454
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:43,438
I don't think so. That's why I like you.

455
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:47,734
You're not innocent at all,
but you're also not bad.

456
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:54,241
So you're a confused mixture.
That's okay. I like it.

457
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:40,162
Hildy. Hildy. Hildy.

458
00:43:41,914 --> 00:43:46,502
Hildy, let's go. Let's go.
The hole's ready.

459
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:48,337
Come on. Come on.

460
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:52,674
Oh, no, Amberline. I can't leave.

461
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:55,719
Can't leave.

462
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:59,097
What? No. Come on.

463
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:02,309
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

464
00:44:21,078 --> 00:44:22,496
My best friend.

465
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:37,553
I'm gonna make it.

466
00:44:58,073 --> 00:44:59,074
Oh, my God.

467
00:51:05,941 --> 00:51:07,651
She came this way!

468
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,754
Fuck.

469
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:52,019
Okay. Okay.

470
00:57:47,259 --> 00:57:51,597
We are in a tough situation.

471
00:57:52,598 --> 00:57:54,725
We're all family here.

472
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:58,520
Brothers, sisters, friends,
fathers, mothers.

473
00:58:00,355 --> 00:58:01,857
And these women

474
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:05,110
have been given the same privileges.

475
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:13,744
The guy by the ATV, you didn't kill him.

476
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:21,502
Amberline, you'll be okay.

477
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:25,756
But what did they do? Huh?

478
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,674
They took advantage of it.

479
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:33,764
Our men were in a dangerous situation.

480
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:38,101
Risking their lives to find her.

481
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:48,195
This is a difficult situation.

482
00:59:02,835 --> 00:59:05,170
I don't know what you
want me to do, Amber.

483
00:59:05,254 --> 00:59:11,510
I have 400 people working under me,
and I have to maintain discipline, so...

484
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:15,347
someone has to be punished.

485
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:22,855
Okay.

486
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,076
You tell me, Amber.

487
00:59:38,829 --> 00:59:40,581
Shoot me, please. Shoot me.

488
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:46,044
I did it, I did it. Shoot me. Shoot me.

489
01:00:13,805 --> 01:00:20,412
