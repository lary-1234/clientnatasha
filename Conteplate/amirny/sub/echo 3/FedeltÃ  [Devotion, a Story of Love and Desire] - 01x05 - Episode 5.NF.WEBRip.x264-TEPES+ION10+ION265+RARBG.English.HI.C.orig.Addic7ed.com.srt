Good morning.

357
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,666
Mm. Breakfast?

358
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,958
Sure. [chuckles]

359
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,458
[doorbell rings]

360
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:45,666
One second!

361
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:48,666
I'm coming!

362
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:54,125
- Who is it?
- [Anna] It's me.

363
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,791
Ah. Here you are.

364
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:00,291
Please. Yes. Come on in.

365
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,208
Who told you I was here?

366
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:09,166
Well, I also have your friends' numbers.
And seeing how you just disappeared...

367
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,500
Whose place is this?

368
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,726
It's Giulia's. It's for artists
when their work's in the gallery.

369
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,833
Listen. Why aren't you at the house? Huh?

370
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:16,958
You're done with Carlo. Is that it?

371
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,791
- I'm not talking about this.
- Oh. We're talking, all right.

372
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,666
Margherita? Why don't you
tell me anything?

373
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,833
What's going on? What tore you apart?

374
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,125
I slept with someone else.

375
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,625
- Who is he?
- What's it matter?

376
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,625
- [Anna] When was this?
- Just leave it alone, Mom!

377
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,166
Margherita.

378
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,541
What were you thinking? What happened?

379
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,250
I don't know.

380
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,750
Nothing.

381
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:49,208
For once, I didn't think.
I just... I mean, I don't know.

382
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:50,791
I followed my instincts.

383
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:53,500
I did what I wanted.
All right? And it just happened.

384
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:56,833
I felt empowered.

385
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:58,958
[scoffs]

386
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,333
Margherita, sweetie.

387
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,000
Look. I understand.

388
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,291
Look. Every marriage has its crisis.

389
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:14,166
But now it's important
you be careful with what you do.

390
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,791
- You <i>have</i> to call Carlo...
- 'Cause that's what you did?

391
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,208
What? Stay faithful to a marriage? I did.

392
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:23,291
No. Stay faithful to your husband
even if he's cheating on you.

393
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:24,625
Carlo is having an affair?

394
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:27,458
It's not about me and Carlo,
this is about you and Papa.

395
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:32,416
What are you saying?

396
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,958
- No. Nothing.
- [Anna] No, no, no, no, no.

397
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:36,083
Tell me. What is it?

398
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,208
Mom, Dad had an affair.

399
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:46,333
It went on for years.

400
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:48,875
Huh.

401
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,041
Honey, what are you saying?

402
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,333
Mom, I'm sorry.

403
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:57,750
I found these letters
he sent to a woman named Clara.

404
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:03,333

408
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:12,541
Sorry.

409
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,208
I'd like to see
the letters he sent to her.

410
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:21,166
After...

411
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:24,333
After a lifetime
of pretending not to see it...

412
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,625
Hold on. You knew about it?

413
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
[scoffs]

414
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:32,875
It was a different time, Margherita.

415
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:35,833
Things were different back then.

416
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:38,083
I couldn't just decide to leave him.

417
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:40,291
You have a decision.

418
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:44,708
But that's why you can't just say
that things happen to you, and that's it

419
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:47,166
because you have the power
to make them happen!

420
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,958

are the best in Rimini.

423
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,041
- [Carlo] Mmm.
- [Sofia chuckles]

424
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:56,750
- They don't skimp on the custard.
- [Carlo] I noticed.

425
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:01,583
Do you always wear that bracelet?

426
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,166
Mm.

427
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,583
It was my mom's.

428
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,833
I actually thought I'd lost it.
I was a wreck.

429
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:15,458
Hey. But then it magically reappeared
in my bag one day.

430
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:16,583
"Magically", huh?

431
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,541
There's no explanation for it.

432
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:25,458
[exhales]

433
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:27,250
Got anything to tell me?

434
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:29,875
I have to go back to Milan.

435
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Okay.

436
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,250
[door opens]

437
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:46,791

I mean, honestly, teaching was just always
what made the most sense to me.

441
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:29,791
It kept me close to writing,
and I was able to pay my rent.

443
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:33,166
Now, I'll just have to do something else.

Another thing
that's fallen apart because of me.

445
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:37,416
No.

446
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:41,458
It's all my fault.
I'm responsible for losing everything.

447
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:44,208
You didn't lose everything, you know.

448
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:45,375
You have your story.

449
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,125

will be considered enough?

around the lighthouse twice, but you know...

It's all right.

Don't worry about it.
You've already done enough.

Like what?

471
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,083
You helped me start over.

472
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:08,916
But?

473
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:11,791
There's a "but", right?

And now, suddenly, everything is changing
from one minute to the next.

And I can't do anything about it.

478

I have to just roll with what is.
