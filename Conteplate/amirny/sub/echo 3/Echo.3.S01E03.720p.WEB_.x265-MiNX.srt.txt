1
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:38,707
Help.

2
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,293
Oh, my God.

3
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:44,087
Oh, fuck!

4
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,756
Oh, fuck!

5
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:50,552
There, there, it's nothing.

6
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:52,470
- Oh, my God.
- They're just ants.

7
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:56,099
Hey. Chill. Pack your
shit. We have to go now.

8
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:57,183
What?

9
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:58,894
We're leaving now. Come on.

10
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,730
Hey. Now!

11
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:07,819
Okay.

12
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:31,718
Eric, it's good to meet you.

13
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,054
Thanks so much for doing
this on such short notice.

14
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:37,724
My pleasure. Anything I can do
to help. Please, let's sit down.

15
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:40,184
TNC NOTICIAS

16
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:51,363
Tonight, the husband of an
American scientist taken hostage

17
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:55,116
in Colombia opens up about
the terrifying abduction.

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,911
Sergeant, thank you very much for
having the time to talk to us.

19
00:01:57,994 --> 00:01:58,912
Thank you.

20
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:01,623
Sergeant, what was the first
thought that you had when you knew

21
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:03,917
that your wife had
been kidnapped?

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,629
I'm going to get her back safe in
my arms if I have to die trying.

23
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:13,969
Our sources say that last night a boy was
shot and killed in a rescue operation.

24
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:15,612
Is that something
you'll confirm to us?

25
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:17,973
I have no idea. I wasn't there.

26
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:21,851
But I have it on good authority that
the Colombian military is all over this.

27
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:24,020
They may have shot a
kidnapper. I don't know.

28
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:27,566
Delta security operations
are highly classified,

29
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:30,694
and it may never be
known to the public.

30
00:02:30,777 --> 00:02:35,949
Is it safe to say that you would never
confirm an operation, something like this?

31
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:40,078
Well, I can confirm
this. I want a mission.

32
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:43,248
I want the Colombian
military to step up.

33
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:47,085
Are you suggesting that the Colombian
government isn't even trying?

34
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:52,757
I'm suggesting there's always more
that can be done for an innocent woman.

35
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:55,635
Sounds like you're calling
out the president of Colombia

36
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:58,972
and perhaps the president of
the United States. Is that so?

37
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:01,224
I do hope they're listening.

38
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:04,185
The buck stops at the top.

39
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:05,937
- Hey, man.
- You fucked me.

40
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:09,441
You fucking fucked me. But I
don't even care about that.

41
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:10,984
You fucked yourself
by going on CNN.

42
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:13,695
What part of "keep a low
profile" don't you understand?

43
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:15,989
Yeah, well, isn't public
pressure good for us?

44
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:18,199
You're on speaker with Prince.

45
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:20,368
- Hey, Prince.
- Hey, Mitch.

46
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:22,287
Pressure's only good
when I generate it.

47
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,748
You do realize now that the
comms guys at the White House

48
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:27,431
and the political shop are gonna
take this over and focus-group it

49
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,169
every fucking step of the way.

50
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:32,589
Now, why would you want
that in an election year?

51
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:35,800
We had no choice.
Everything's moving too slow.

52
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:38,511
So you go shoot up an
entire neighborhood

53
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:41,306
and call out the Colombian
president on national television?

54
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:43,391
Super fucking dumb.

55
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:45,936
Do you really want the
Colombian military on this,

56
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,647
with their record of hostage
rescue and cross fire?

57
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,524
They shoot both the
rebels and the hostages.

58
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:54,110
We're gonna be on their
op. Make sure she's safe.

59
00:04:13,547 --> 00:04:16,882
Be more careful. Nobody's fucking
carrying you if you twist an ankle.

60
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,569
We're going in a circle.

61
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:37,654
Hey.

62
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:12,230
Set up your hammock and get
some sleep while you can.

63
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,903
You bring us back fucking here!

64
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:27,829
You're...

65
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:46,991
ESCUELA MILITAR DE SUBOFICIALES
SARGENTO INOCENCIO CHINCA

66
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:49,392
If everything was kept
on my side, in my house,

67
00:05:49,476 --> 00:05:51,853
maybe I could have
worked it out.

68
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:55,273
But now this operation
is no longer a secret.

69
00:05:55,357 --> 00:06:00,195
You see, we have a new spokesperson,
and he got us a new mission.

70
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,740
We're going to engage.

71
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:07,744
That's good news.

72
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:11,915
So, when you're ready to launch,
attach us as advisers so we can help.

73
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,335
Thanks for the offer, but no.

74
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:17,963
Anything else?

75
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:20,924
Yes, sir. We need to go there.

76
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:22,551
No, you don't.

77
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:27,138
We're requesting to be
there. Professional courtesy.

78
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:32,018
Courtesy? You
called us out on TV.

79
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,649
Well, maybe your friends in the
CIA are gonna force us to take you,

80
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:39,234
but I don't think so.

81
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:42,696
- Sir, we...
- Thank you, sir. We understand.

82
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:52,372
We need to talk to him
outside of his office.

83
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:53,540
What are you thinking?

84
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:55,083
I'm gonna bribe his ass.

85
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:18,440
Didn't Ernesto say the
general was coming alone?

86
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:20,942
He did.

87
00:07:39,586 --> 00:07:42,631
Good afternoon, everyone.
Thank you for being here.

88
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:45,884
Ernesto and I are so
pleased that you can join us

89
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:50,263
for our 5th Gala fundraiser
of the Walasa Foundation.

90
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:58,230
We are continuing to make a difference
in the lives of so many children

91
00:07:58,313 --> 00:08:01,024
suffering from violence
in rural Colombia.

92
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:02,107
Thank you very much.

93
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:06,780
"Despite progress,

94
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:10,867
poverty and hunger are on the
rise in many parts of Colombia.

95
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:16,873
Since we began, The Walasa Foundation
has helped nourish hundreds of children.

96
00:08:16,957 --> 00:08:21,628
Supplying meals in areas where
previously there were none.

97
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:26,091
And we continue to fight to
provide relief to the little ones."

98
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:28,510
General.

99
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:31,054
Thank you for inviting me.

100
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:33,472
But why am I here?

101
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:36,058
It's part of my job to mingle
with these people, Pereira.

102
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:38,937
You are here to keep
me from killing them.

103
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:43,858
Don't complain. At
least the food is good.

104
00:08:44,943 --> 00:08:45,860
Gracias.

105
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:47,195
General.

106
00:08:53,118 --> 00:08:55,495
May I please speak with
the Colonel for a moment?

107
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,458
Gracias.

108
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:04,296
General.

109
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:05,839
I know you're aware of…

110
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:09,801
the terrible situation
that my wife is in.

111
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:10,719
Sí.

112
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:15,098
And… Well, I know we're
asking for a favor.

113
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:21,396
But if you can see your way fit to
bending the rules for us, just this once,

114
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:24,357
I hope you'll also see your way
to letting us return the favor.

115
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:27,235
Do you understand in which
position you put me in?

116
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:30,155
You took advantage of my trust.

117
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:34,618
You know, my family owns a company
with a lot of interests in the region.

118
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:37,704
I could have had my snipers
to shoot you. You know that?

119
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:38,787
But you didn't.

120
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:42,542
Want to offer you a seat on
the board of Haas Industries.

121
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:45,837
We meet three times a
year. It's a paid position.

122
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:50,508
General.

123
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,093
General.

124
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:54,596
Thank you for coming.

125
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:57,241
I'm sorry we didn't get a
chance to speak tonight.

126
00:09:57,265 --> 00:10:01,353
I would like to discuss the
shooting in Ciudad Bolívar.

127
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:03,539
You should talk to the Narcotics
Unit, I'm not involved.

128
00:10:03,563 --> 00:10:05,899
Nevertheless, I would
like to hear your opinion.

129
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:07,525
I'm sorry. I don't think so.

130
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:09,444
Is that an official
"no comment?"

131
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:12,697
Listen, I really appreciate
your charitable spirit.

132
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:13,781
But I know who you are.

133
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,786
And I know, you have been treated
better here than in your own country.

134
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:20,038
I'm sure you'd want
to keep it that way.

135
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:22,374
Excuse me.

136
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:36,763
This is Violeta Matíz, and
this is "Bogotá Revealed,"

137
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:37,847
on 103.1 F.M.

138
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:42,852
Many times on this show
we have talked about war

139
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:45,146
and the terrible toll it
has taken on our country.

140
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:48,942
And while the war may
be officially over,

141
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:51,361
there is still violence.

142
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:56,866
I want to talk about an American woman
who was recently abducted outside Bogotá.

143
00:10:57,784 --> 00:10:58,910
Amber Chesborough.

144
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:04,249
Her brother Alex joins me in
the studio to deliver a message,

145
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:07,752
as we have done on many
occasions on "Kidnapped Voices."

146
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:12,674
I'll turn it over to her brother
so he can speak to her directly.

147
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:24,102
Amber…

148
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:35,488
if you're out there and you're
listening, it's me, and I'm on it.

149
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:40,827
We're all so worried
about you, and…

150
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:47,125
well, everyone's just waiting
patiently for the process to play out.

151
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:51,630
But you did nothing
wrong, baby. Nothing.

152
00:11:58,136 --> 00:11:59,512
We love you, baby.

153
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:04,017
We're gonna find a
peaceful way out of this.

154
00:12:05,477 --> 00:12:06,561
He's good.

155
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:10,482
No, this is not good. It's shit.

156
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,527
We're losing control
of the narrative.

157
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:16,738
I need you to stay warm

158
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:21,952
and stay dry, and
be patient, okay?

159
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:24,454
I'd like to send a
message to the kidnappers…

160
00:12:24,537 --> 00:12:27,165
I'm here if you want
to speak with me.

161
00:12:27,249 --> 00:12:28,249
To listen to you

162
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:30,502
without any conditions

163
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:34,256
to deliver whatever message
you want to send to the world.

164
00:12:35,006 --> 00:12:37,551
Let's tell the boss
to bring that bitch.

165
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,017
And we're out.

166
00:13:08,123 --> 00:13:09,332
What's wrong?

167
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,459
Why don't we let
the American go?

168
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:12,377
No.

169
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,756
I just think this whole
plan could get us killed.

170
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,924
That's not going to happen.

171
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,845
We have the advantage and have
worked too hard for this opportunity.

172
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:25,932
It's crazy to bring
a journalist here

173
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:27,118
to the middle of the jungle.

174
00:13:27,142 --> 00:13:28,142
I don't see the point.

175
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:34,608
Relax. When we get to Venezuela,

176
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:38,862
the SEBIN will put
an altar for us.

177
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:40,280
They will kiss our feet.

178
00:13:40,363 --> 00:13:41,573
And that's what you want?

179
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:43,408
I want respect!

180
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:45,327
Wonderful.

181
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:48,163
Poetic.

182
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:56,922
To be able to hold an American
hostage is the ultimate.

183
00:13:57,547 --> 00:14:01,134
It shows that we are strong
and the government is weak.

184
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:03,720
And to be able to
break that illusion

185
00:14:04,471 --> 00:14:06,932
of a powerful and
authoritarian government.

186
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:09,559
It legitimizes us as a
revolutionary movement.

187
00:14:09,643 --> 00:14:11,895
And it makes people think,

188
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:16,149
"The government must be very weak if
it can't save one fucking American."

189
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:25,116
Once that idea gets
planted like a seed,

190
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:27,994
another one grows.

191
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:32,415
"If the government is that
bad, we have to change it."

192
00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:37,546
That's what we are doing,
giving hope to our people.

193
00:14:55,814 --> 00:14:58,483
- Trust me.
- When have I ever not trusted you?

194
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:00,986
I love you.

195
00:15:02,654 --> 00:15:03,905
Manipulator.

196
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:16,418
For you. Hurry!

197
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:18,128
Move. Ándale.

198
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:10,138
The Comandante is waiting.

199
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,979
Don't make him angry.

200
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,737
Pleasure to meet you.

201
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:27,989
The pleasure is mine.

202
00:16:28,073 --> 00:16:30,700
Did you have a good trip?

203
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:32,911
You must be exhausted.

204
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:35,163
Would you like
some food or water?

205
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:37,040
Or rest for a while?

206
00:16:37,123 --> 00:16:38,625
I'm fine.

207
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,335
Sit.

208
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:49,553
You know this is
a mistake, right?

209
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:51,846
And it will end badly.

210
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:55,016
The mistake is theirs.

211
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,519
They thought they
were untouchable.

212
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:01,231
And if this turns out bad, well,

213
00:17:01,314 --> 00:17:03,108
these are risks we
take during war.

214
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:05,651
If you really want to
teach a lesson, let her go.

215
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,112
Nobody wants to
return to the past.

216
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:14,160
Some people do want another
war and we'll give it to them.

217
00:17:14,244 --> 00:17:17,330
If you release her, I'll
write a nice story about you.

218
00:17:17,414 --> 00:17:18,622
I would like that.

219
00:17:18,707 --> 00:17:22,960
But that's a bit too romantic
for things to end up that way.

220
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:24,379
What are your goals?

221
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:26,089
Who are you?

222
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:28,216
I'm just a man.

223
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:32,053
Trying to create
a new atmosphere.

224
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:33,597
A new mentality.

225
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,182
And these are my friends.

226
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,352
Talk to her.

227
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:42,188
Tell me what you think.

228
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,690
Think about what?

229
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:47,777
Whether or not she is CIA.

230
00:17:48,403 --> 00:17:49,988
You think she will tell me?

231
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,033
Find out. You can do it.

232
00:17:54,034 --> 00:17:55,076
Go ahead.

233
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:56,870
Okay.

234
00:17:57,621 --> 00:17:59,372
Give me some time
with her. I'll try.

235
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:01,666
Let's get ready to move.

236
00:18:23,813 --> 00:18:25,148
Hello, Amber.

237
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:30,695
- I'm a journalist. I want to talk to you.
- I recognize your voice.

238
00:18:31,988 --> 00:18:33,531
- From the radio.
- Yeah.

239
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:35,367
Your brother is a friend.

240
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:38,954
And your father-in-law
is my husband's friend.

241
00:18:39,037 --> 00:18:40,080
I wanna help you.

242
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:43,541
Thank you.

243
00:18:50,465 --> 00:18:52,968
Do you know why you
were taken in this way?

244
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:56,304
Wrong place, wrong time.

245
00:18:56,972 --> 00:18:59,558
They think I'm CIA.
It's fucking ridiculous.

246
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:02,310
I know how you feel.

247
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:06,021
I was kidnapped.

248
00:19:08,608 --> 00:19:12,779
I was in a very small
room during two months.

249
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:19,035
I hope you don't
go through that.

250
00:19:20,495 --> 00:19:24,541
But if you do, you have
to know you will survive.

251
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:30,505
They want to know if
you're an American agent.

252
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:33,425
I don't care if you are or not.

253
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:39,347
I'm going to talk with the commander
right now and tell him you're innocent.

254
00:19:44,144 --> 00:19:47,105
You should stay with
me. It's much safer.

255
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:59,784
They're all gonna get killed
in this camp. Everyone.

256
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:04,414
Don't fantasize of a rescue.

257
00:20:05,707 --> 00:20:08,293
They can't find this place
in the middle of the jungle.

258
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:10,587
You don't know my family.

259
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,800
I guarantee you they
tracked you here.

260
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:19,930
Why do you think my
brother did your show?

261
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:24,351
You're a bird dog.

262
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:27,604
You flush out the prey.

263
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,649
Time's up.

264
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:35,362
- Everything will be okay.
- Right.

265
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,669
I have eyes on Violeta.

266
00:20:55,382 --> 00:20:57,551
I see at least 20% of the camp.

267
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:00,929
Negative on Amber.

268
00:21:03,056 --> 00:21:04,724
Here she is.

269
00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:05,976
Come here.

270
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,603
Tell me how it went.

271
00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:12,607
I do have something for you.

272
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:13,733
She's not CIA.

273
00:21:13,817 --> 00:21:16,987
- This is your professional opinion?
- Sí.

274
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,739
After conducting interviews
for 20 years, I can confirm it.

275
00:21:19,823 --> 00:21:21,283
Let her leave with me.

276
00:21:31,376 --> 00:21:32,544
Graciela.

277
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:34,211
Do something for me.

278
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:37,591
Take her and tie her up.

279
00:21:37,674 --> 00:21:39,114
Then tell everyone
we're moving out.

280
00:21:44,306 --> 00:21:45,807
We're moving out.

281
00:21:51,855 --> 00:21:53,857
They're packing up,
getting ready to move.

282
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:56,109
Colonel?

283
00:22:01,823 --> 00:22:04,284
We have located the rebel camp.

284
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,630
Where they are holding
the American hostage.

285
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:12,667
Now they have a second hostage,
a journalist, Violeta Matíz.

286
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,213
- What's happening?
- They believe you.

287
00:22:16,796 --> 00:22:18,236
We are going to
intercept them here.

288
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:20,749
We are going to surround them.

289
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:23,261
We are going to
make them desperate.

290
00:22:30,894 --> 00:22:34,189
Force them to negotiate,
to make mistakes.

291
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:37,025
There are a lot of
eyes watching us.

292
00:22:39,694 --> 00:22:40,694
Get ready.

293
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:43,615
Any questions?

294
00:22:46,451 --> 00:22:47,452
That's the way I like it.

295
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,454
Commandos, move out!

296
00:23:32,205 --> 00:23:34,249
They're headed to the river.

297
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:38,879
Do not engage. We're
10 minutes out.

298
00:26:58,954 --> 00:27:02,249
This is Colonel Pereira of
the Colombian National Army.

299
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,710
You are completely surrounded.

300
00:27:05,794 --> 00:27:08,213
This is now my battleground.

301
00:27:09,005 --> 00:27:11,591
I decide what happens to you.

302
00:27:12,884 --> 00:27:16,638
No one will leave here alive with
Amber Chesborough or Violeta Matíz.

303
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:22,143
You will all die
here one by one.

304
00:27:22,227 --> 00:27:24,563
Unless you release the hostages.

305
00:27:26,231 --> 00:27:27,524
I have plenty of time.

306
00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:31,778
You decide.

307
00:27:50,797 --> 00:27:52,007
I have the Comandante.

308
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:56,386
Fire.

309
00:28:02,475 --> 00:28:04,352
We just killed your Comandante.

310
00:28:04,436 --> 00:28:05,896
It was easy.

311
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:12,736
I can stay here indefinitely.

312
00:28:14,738 --> 00:28:16,031
For hours…

313
00:28:17,699 --> 00:28:18,700
for weeks.

314
00:28:21,202 --> 00:28:22,454
You decide.

315
00:28:55,737 --> 00:28:57,197
Make the fucking call.

316
00:29:34,985 --> 00:29:37,654
They just blew up
a café in Bogotá.

317
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:53,670
This is Foster. Connect
me to the SecDef, please.

318
00:29:56,172 --> 00:29:58,133
Sir, we have a credible threat.

319
00:29:58,216 --> 00:30:00,416
They're claiming to have more
bombs throughout the city.

320
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:14,107
General, we have
them surrounded!

321
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,775
I can capture them all!

322
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:20,030
It doesn't matter. They
threatened to bomb more civilians.

323
00:30:20,113 --> 00:30:22,866
This comes from the top. From
the White House and the CIA.

324
00:30:22,949 --> 00:30:24,034
Do you understand?

325
00:30:24,117 --> 00:30:26,036
They don't want more
civilian casualties.

326
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,211
Attention, everyone.

327
00:30:34,294 --> 00:30:36,254
Abort, abort, abort.

328
00:30:37,172 --> 00:30:38,506
Retreat.

329
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,050
We're headed back to base.

330
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,306
There's nothing we can do.

331
00:31:51,288 --> 00:31:52,998
Fuck you!

332
00:31:53,832 --> 00:31:56,126
Yes! Fuck you!

333
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:04,426
Fuck you!

334
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:09,264
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck
you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

335
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:18,815
I love you.

336
00:33:33,682 --> 00:33:35,267
Trust me, Colonel.

337
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,851
I know. Politics.

338
00:33:36,935 --> 00:33:40,188
But we are under a lot
of pressure to withdraw.

339
00:33:41,523 --> 00:33:42,732
It's a sad day.

340
00:33:42,816 --> 00:33:44,526
General, the day isn't over.

341
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,821
It will take them 9 hours
to get to the border.

342
00:33:47,904 --> 00:33:51,575
Sir, if you can give me a bird,
we can take one more shot at this.

343
00:33:51,658 --> 00:33:54,327
The media has us
in a bad position.

344
00:33:55,787 --> 00:33:57,122
It's our country, sir.

345
00:33:57,205 --> 00:33:58,206
You're right.

346
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:00,125
It's our country.

347
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:02,961
I say this unofficially.

348
00:34:03,545 --> 00:34:07,007
Take volunteers and do
what you think is right.

349
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:10,594
Commandos…

350
00:34:12,846 --> 00:34:14,681
I need nine volunteers.

351
00:34:27,318 --> 00:34:28,528
Caballeros.

352
00:34:28,612 --> 00:34:32,324
We aren't done. Load
up. We leave at dawn.

353
00:36:01,204 --> 00:36:02,622
Signal intelligence say

354
00:36:02,706 --> 00:36:05,208
they are in trucks on
a slow jungle road.

355
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:07,252
We can cut across
the jungle by air

356
00:36:07,335 --> 00:36:08,795
and beat them to the border.

357
00:36:10,046 --> 00:36:12,173
This spot here is
the perfect ambush.

358
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:14,259
Three guys on the ridge.

359
00:36:14,342 --> 00:36:15,594
The rest with me.

360
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:17,012
We'll attack from the ground.

361
00:36:57,761 --> 00:37:00,222
IED armed and ready.

362
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:01,306
Check.

363
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:45,725
All stations, all stations. I
will initiate on the lead vehicle.

364
00:38:37,027 --> 00:38:38,445
Bambi, what do you got?

365
00:38:59,883 --> 00:39:01,301
Not a lot of targets here.

366
00:39:01,384 --> 00:39:02,384
Roger.

367
00:40:39,816 --> 00:40:40,942
What are you seeing?

368
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:44,321
Bambi, I got nothing.

369
00:40:55,957 --> 00:40:57,042
Fuck.

370
00:40:59,794 --> 00:41:01,463
They're covered.

371
00:41:04,216 --> 00:41:05,675
All stations hold.

372
00:41:14,935 --> 00:41:16,686
I've got more vehicles inbound.

373
00:41:19,189 --> 00:41:21,650
Prince, you've gotta fucking go.

374
00:41:21,733 --> 00:41:23,360
I can't see Amber.

375
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:25,987
Thirty seconds out.

376
00:41:27,614 --> 00:41:30,283
Go! Fucking do something!

377
00:41:32,452 --> 00:41:34,329
Prince, go now!

378
00:41:45,549 --> 00:41:48,301
Prince, go, fucking go! Now!

379
00:41:50,345 --> 00:41:52,722
Colonel, I got Violeta!

380
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:07,946
I'm moving down.

381
00:42:08,822 --> 00:42:10,865
- Hold those trucks and cover me!
- Yeah!

382
00:43:09,925 --> 00:43:11,593
I got Amber!

383
00:43:54,511 --> 00:43:57,222
Alex!

384
00:44:01,685 --> 00:44:03,228
Alex!
