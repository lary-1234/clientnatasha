00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,541
You just don't realize
how big of a mess you've made. Do you?

179
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:54,083
With what you've been doing,
what am I supposed to do about you now?

180
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,291
I'm your fucking business partner!

181
00:11:58,916 --> 00:11:59,916
Eva...

182
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,416
Eva, please. I won't give you
any more reasons to doubt me. I promise.

183
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,125
- We'll sell that house.
- No. Look. I'll take care of it. Okay?

184
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,000
No. Really. I'll take care of it, Eva.

185
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,583
Trust me. We'll sort this out.

186
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,750
Listen, Margherita.

187
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,916
I have an appointment right now.
All right?

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,333
And I like to be punctual.

189
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,958
Especially, since we can't afford
to lose any more of our clients.

190
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,041
Okay?

191
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,541
[sighs]

192
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,666
[indistinct chatter]

193
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,750
Good morning.

194
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,791
Good morning.

195
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,000
[melancholy music playing]

196
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:56,833
One of the... the problems
that surely... you'll face

197
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,541
is writing the ending of your story.

198
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,958
This entails

199
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,875
making a decision about whether
to resolve your protagonist's journey,

200
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,416
or to leave it... unfinished.

201
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,375
So is it a better option

202
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,000
to use an open ending, a suspension,

203
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:17,625
or to give it a bitter ending,
which sometimes is just inevitable, huh?

204
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,916
[jazzy music playing]

205
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,666
[indistinct chatter]

206
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,916
- Giulia?
- [door closes]

207
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Marghe.

208
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:44,750
How are you?

209
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,666
[Giulia inhales]

210
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,875
I think we should sit down
before I answer.

211
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,125
I ordered you a smoothie.
A super detox one with dandelion.

212
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,208
You know the stuff.

213
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,708
Hmm. Thanks.

214
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,125
It's as disgusting as my life is.

215
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,291
- Excuse me?
- [waiter] Yes?

216
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,750
Can I have a double whiskey?
And a prosecco.

217
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,750
- You still like prosecco, don't you?
- Yeah. Of course I do.

218
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,416
[sighs heavily]

219
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,208
Sorry.

220
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,958
I'm really sorry, Marghe.
I've been terrible to you too.

221
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,583
I was disappointed, Giulia.

222
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,083
This is all huge,
and you didn't tell me anything.

223
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm your friend.

224
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,166
I didn't know how... how to tell you.

225
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,958
Everything I was sure of is gone, and, uh...

226
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,875
[inhales] ...even my stability too.

227
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,708
And, um... Hmm.

228
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,583
[sniffles, clears throat]

229
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,958
So what happened?

230
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,916
How did it start?

231
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,250
One night at the gallery.

232
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,166
He's a French painter.
He was in Milan for a little bit.

233
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,948
Makes these beautiful paintings

234
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,416
with Renaissance
architectonic elements, like...

235
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
And?

236
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,708
He liked me.

237
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,000
He was coming on to me.

238
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:02,458
He waited for me every night after work,
and things were tough with Marco, Marghe.

239
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,208
I was exhausted, and...

240
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,500
I gave in to him.

241
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,000
I slept with him.

242
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,000
And, um, I... I actually liked it.

243
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,250
Um, I liked myself again.
It made me happy.

244
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:13,916
And now?

245
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,500
I don't care about him at all.

246
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,500
I screwed up with Marco,
and I don't know how to fix it. So, um...

247
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,583
Hmm.

248
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,666
[waiter] There you go.

249
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,750
[Giulia] Thanks.

250
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,166
You can take away the, um...

251
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,291
- Slow down.
- [Giulia] No.

252
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,291
No. It's not the time to slow down.

253
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,958
It's actually time to get to the point.

254
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,666
[breathes sharply] So, come on.

255
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,500
What did he say to Carlo last night?

256
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,583
Hmm?

257
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,041
Hmm?

258
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,375
To Carlo?

259
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,541
Yeah. They met. Right?
When the bistro closed.

260
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,083
Marco said he was going
to meet up with Carlo. Hmm?

261
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,166
Oh God. That was a lie, wasn't it?

262
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,416
[exhales] He met somebody.

263
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,666
[scoffs]

264
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,541
- No. Absolutely not. No.
- [Giulia] Hmm.

265
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,208
Giulia, listen to me.

266
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,251
Last night, I went to bed early,
and got up early.

267
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,000
I left the house,
and I didn't even see Carlo before I left.

268
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,125
That's why I think it's...

269
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,083
It's, uh... it's... it's the truth. Right?

270
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,583
- Yeah.
- [Giulia] Mm.

271
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,375
Because I know what happens
when someone cheats.

272
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,541
It's one lie...

273
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,875
one lie after the other.

274
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,458
- Excuse me?
- [waiter] Yes.

275
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,000
The element of surprise it's crucial.

276
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,875
What you're missing here
is a good old, unexpected plot twist.

277
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,708
- And that's it.
- Okay. Great.

278
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,666
Anyway, congratulations.
You did a great job. Bravo.

279
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,750
Thank you.

280
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,875
Is your life really as dynamic as this?

281
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,416
Uh, no. Well, I...

282
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
[chuckles]

283
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,875
The story has a touch of fantasy.

284
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:48,958
[Carlo] Oh, okay.

285
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,416
Yeah. I mean, what can I do?

286
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,666
I haven't actually gone through
many shitty moments in my life, so...

287
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,041
Hey. There's nothing wrong with a bit
of fantasy for the sake of a great story.

288
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,666
- Thanks, a lot.
- Well done. Okay. See you tomorrow.

More?

No.

I called a taxi. Thanks.

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,416
Maybe next time, though.

309
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,250
Anytime.

[birds chirping]

315
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,166
So you have no valid excuse
for being absent today?

316
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,250
No, no, no. It's valid.

317
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,916
I got completely sucked in
to this one novel.

318
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,458
So much so it made me
wanna try writing one again.

319
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,291
Hmm. What book was it?

320
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,041
It's yours.

321
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:23,958
You liked it?

322
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,750
[Sofia] A lot.

323
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:31,375
Your way of narrating pain
is something I relate to.

324
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,083
- "Pain," huh?
- Mm-hmm.

325
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,166
Are you sure it was my book you read?

326
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,958
I don't narrate pain.

327
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,625
Don't you?

328
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,541
What was it
that made you so anxious the other day?

329
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,833
It wasn't the first I felt like that.

330
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,583
I get hit with sudden memories

331
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,500
of something
that I thought I'd put behind me,

332
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,625
but that's still right here.

333
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,666
And it's painful?

334
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,750
Hmm.

335
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,333
Well, you should use it.

336
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,208
The pain, use it in your writing.

337
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,416
I can't find the right words
to write about it.

338
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,791
I'd have to invent new ones.

339
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,708
[chuckles] Fantastic! Do it. Why not?

340
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,333
You're free. You can do anything you want!

341
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,416
That's what I was just telling Leonardo.

342
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,916
When it comes to writing,
not every rule has to be respected.

Come on. Let's go.

[chuckles] Where?

348
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,666
To the perfect place
for you to find the words.

[indistinct chatter]

350
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:56,791
[Carlo] Hmm.

351
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,875
There we go.

352
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,125
This is one of my favorite authors.

353
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,416
After you read this one,

354
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,583
you're gonna wanna read the whole trilogy,
and then all the rest too.

355
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,958
"There's a very thin line
between how we hide from the world

356
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,833
and how we choose to show up."

357
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,750
[alternative music playing over radio]

358
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,916
So you're saying you've already read
all of MacKinnon at 20,

359
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,833
and that my tastes
aren't all that sophisticated after all?

360
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,958
- I should've indulged you.
- Yeah. You should've.

361
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,708
- Carlo!
- [Carlo] Luca...

362
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,125
How nice to see you here. Hi.

363
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,041
- [Carlo] Uh...
- Hello.

364
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:31,041
This is Sofia.
She's my student and she's, uh...

365
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,541
This is Luca. He's, uh, my... my editor.

366
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,125
Nice to meet you.

367
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:36,666
I'm enchanted.

368
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:41,125
Right. Luca's the man to know
if you wanna publish your first book,

369
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,125
and the one to avoid
if you have to deliver a second one.

370
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:47,375
- Oh. And to that regard, I...
- You are about to get something to read.

371
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,208
[both chuckle]

372
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,833
Do you know how many times
I've heard that? Do you?

373
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,666
I beg of you, never say that.

374
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,916
Instead, you should be
that rare type of writer

375
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,240
that doesn't ever keep the editors
waiting for your work.

376
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,583
I'll keep that in mind. Thanks.

377
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:02,750
Thank you, Luca. Thanks.

378
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,500
Uh, yeah. That's good.

379
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,833
It's good that you're bringing the new
generation to events like this one. Hmm?

380
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,916
If there wasn't such a, uh, let's say gap,

381
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,080
between practice and theory
in these writing schools,

382
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,625
you know, maybe I'd read less rubbish.

383
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:16,875
You know?

384
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,583
Uh, yeah.

385
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,666
Mm-hmm.

386
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:21,916
Right.

387
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:25,250
Well, I have to go.
I have to host, so, ciao!

388
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:26,416
See you in a moment.

389
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,666
[chuckles]

390
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:32,416
Obviously, I have absolutely no idea
what event he's talking about,

391
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,541
but you don't have to stay with me.

392
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,916
No, no. I want to.

393
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,291
I wouldn't wanna disappoint
your editor, would I?

394
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:40,958
[clears throat]

395
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:45,583

396
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,583
[indistinct chatter]

397
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:02,666
I'll go sit in the front.

398
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,250
Thanks.

399
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:08,375
So, anyway, I have to say
of course I'm sorry about the delay.

400
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,041
I apologize. [chuckles]

401
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:13,041
- [woman] Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
- [Luca] A round of applause!

402
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,541
Should I read a little excerpt?

403
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,916
Of course. Why not?

404
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,583
"We have this need
for things to end right away

405
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,958
so that they never end again.

A ghost of future memory,
sweet regret endured in advance.

407
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:36,291
Something we are able to commemorate

408
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,750
and say we were given another chance."

409
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:40,666
Wow.

410
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,750
So, in your book, you're talking, uh,

411
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:46,375
about the fascinating idea of things
that we haven't experienced,

412
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,125
and how we mystify an idea,

413
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:52,458
a mere thought of what may have been,
but, um... but hasn't.

414
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,750
- Well, yes, more or less.
- [Luca chuckles]

415
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,541
Excuse me. Has anyone read the book?

416
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,166
Besides me, obviously.

417
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,541
- Hi! What's your name?
- Sofia.

418
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,250
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

419
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,875
Yeah, no. I was just wondering
about the ending, Ms. Grilli...

420
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:07,083
Oh. Alessandra.

421
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:08,000
[both chuckle]

422
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:09,458
Alessandra, when you imply

423
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,708
that what's really interesting
and what makes us happy

424
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:15,833
are the challenges
we've actually had the courage to face,

425
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:17,791
not just our dreams.

426
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:21,083
If I... I'm remembering right,
there's a passage, um...

427
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:24,625
"Life is what is left
after every crossroad."

428
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:26,458
- "Crossroad." That's right.
- [Sofia] Yeah.

429
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:32,166
Which means that the responsibility
of choosing our path is ours alone.

430
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,458
Well... [chuckles] ...I think
you understand better than my editor.

431
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:37,291
- [audience laughing]
- [Alessandra] Brava.

432
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:39,375
Since Sofia gracefully brought it up,

433
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:40,916
I wanted to, uh...

434
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,500
to speak about choice and responsibility.

435
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,625
About how important
a difficult moment can be

436
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:50,125
because those are the moments
that form our character.

437

[dramatic music playing]

438
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,708
[Carlo] You've read Grilli's book too?

439
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:54,791
[chuckles] Yep!

440
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,125
- What's it like?
- Wonderful!

441
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:58,458
I could lend it to you.

00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:06,375
No. We shouldn't.

445
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:09,625
Even if we just get one
from that table over there?

446
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,250
No.

447
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,500
Okay.

448
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:16,541
See you in class tomorrow.

449
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,208

462

To take you home.

463
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:32,500
How?

I hate what happened to us.

I can't stand living without you.

at my mom's a few days ago.

are gonna be like they were before.

- Uh, what? No!

Sorry. You just seem
really distracted lately. You know?

522
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,666
But maybe just my instinct's wrong.
Hey. It happens.

523
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:49,916
Actually, maybe Carlo's kinda cheating
with a student of his.

524
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,708
What do you mean "kinda cheating"?

525
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:53,583
Either he's cheating on you or he's not.

526
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:55,625
Otherwise, it'd be hell.
All those gray areas?

527
00:31:55,708 --> 00:31:58,750
Well, there are desires and fantasies.

528
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,750
Yeah. I mean, if we paid attention
to desires and fantasies,

00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:04,250
we'd feel like
we were all cheating all the time.

530
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,500
Oh, honey. I mean,
your face says it all right now.

- Bye, guys. See you tomorrow.
- See you. Bye.

535
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:26,750
- Sorry, but I can't. It makes me...
- But why?

536
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:28,892
- Wasn't it planned?
- [Leonardo] Yeah. It was planned.

537

[both chuckle]

538
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:43,875
Luca! Listen, I know you're super busy,

539
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:46,101
but just let me know
if you're coming to the symposium.

540
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:48,416
I wanted you
to have a chat with the students.

Ciao.

545
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,000
Going out tonight?

546
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:43,541
No. I'm going home.

547
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,666
- Have a good evening, then.
- [Margherita] Ciao.

548
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:52,750

553
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,791
I'll take you home. It's late.

554
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,333
All right, then.

555
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:50,875
But don't take me home.

556
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:56,458
[inhales deeply]

557
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:02,041
