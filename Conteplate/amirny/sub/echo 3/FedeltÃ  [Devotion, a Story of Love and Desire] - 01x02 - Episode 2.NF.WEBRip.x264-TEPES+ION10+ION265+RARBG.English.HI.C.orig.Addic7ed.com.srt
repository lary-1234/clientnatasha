A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,041
[dramatic music playing]

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:15,250
Well, I had given everyone
an exercise to do in class.

4
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,125
An autobiographic story.

5
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:20,083
I asked them to tell me about
an important event that happened to them.

6
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,291
It's a difficult exercise for me.

7
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,291
I like making stories up,

8
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,666
but I don't like
talking about myself so much.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,125
[sighs]

10
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,708
The girl was struggling.
She didn't feel well.

11
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,166
I was very flustered.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,083
Uh, at a certain point
I couldn't take it anymore,

13
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:40,333
so I... I left the classroom
and went to the bathroom.

14
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,000
She looked really startled.

15
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,958
I wanted to make sure
it was nothing serious.

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,875
Then what happened?

17
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,916
Then he followed me into the bathroom.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,125
Then I went in and asked
how she was doing, if she was okay.

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,375
And then?

20
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,833
I leaned against the sink.

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,750
I could barely breathe.
I couldn't get myself to calm down.

22
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,666
The girl that saw you together

23
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,166
said that you were very close.

24
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,875
That you were hugging.

25
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:12,833
[Carlo] No.

26
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,583
No. We weren't hugging.

27
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,833
I knew I was going to pass out.

28
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,250
Uh, so yeah,
the professor was holding me up.

29
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,458
When I got closer,

30
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:23,416
she closed her eyes
and, um, fell into my arms.

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,500
That's all.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,416
It's different.
Uh, it's not what I would call hugging.

33
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:33,625
Do you have anything to report
about Professor Pentecoste's behavior?

34
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,041
What do you mean?

35
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:38,333
[man] Has he ever shown
special interest towards you?

36
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:39,833
No.

37
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,541
Have you ever seen the girl
outside of university?

38
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:46,625
No.

39
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:50,625
I mean, only during our individual
meetings as part of the program.

40
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,833
He just encouraged me to write.

41
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,500
We get along very well.
He's an excellent professor.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,625
The university's reputation is at stake.

43
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,666
As well as yours, naturally.

44
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,750
That's why I wanted to clear things up
and discard any ambiguities.

45
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,333
Nothing happened in the bathroom.

46
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,541
I just wanted to help her.

47
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,708
[exhales]

48
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,125
Whatever has been said...

49
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,250
- It was just a big misunderstanding.
- A big misunderstanding.

50
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,333
[door closes]

51
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,875
[music fades]

52
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,041
[keys jangling]

53
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:36,791
[sighs]

54
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,666
[pan sizzling]

55
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,916
- I'm home.
- [Margherita] Hey!

56
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,416
What happened?
Are we celebrating something?

57
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,458
No. I just had some free time.

58
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,166
And so you decided to cook, huh?

59
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,458
A little bit. Yeah.

60
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,291
Something very, very, very smoky?

61
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,375
No.

62
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:58,708
- What?
- Hmm?

63
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,250
Oh shit! The zucchinis!

64
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,916
- [Margherita] No!
- [Carlo] What?

65
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,500
No. Go sit down. Sit down.

66
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,333
[dish clattering]

67
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:10,958
[Margherita] Whatever.

68
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,500
Okay. So couscous with mint,
salmon, and cherry tomatoes.

69
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,416
Mmm!

70
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,250
There's also the zucchini,

71
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,041
but they didn't make it.

72
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,291
[Carlo chuckles]

73
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,375
Looks good.

74
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,871
- Now try it and let me know.
- [Carlo clears throat]

75
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,041
Be honest. Okay?

76
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,666
Mmm.

77
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,625
- You don't like it?
- Mmm. It's good.

78
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:33,791
It's exotic.

79
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,535
I can tell you don't like it.

80
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,791
- You're a terrible liar. No. You don't.
- [Carlo] I do.

81
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:38,875
[Carlo chuckles]

82
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:40,875
[Margherita] Listen...

83
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,041
I have something to tell you.

84
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,125
Me too.

85
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,041
Tell me.

86
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,416
[Carlo sighs]

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,875
Something happened at the university.

88
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:53,958
What?

89
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:58,083
A girl didn't feel well
during an exercise in class.

90
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,291
She had a sort of a panic attack.

91
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:01,958
[breathes deeply]

92
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,041
I was in the hallway,
and I saw her go into the bathroom.

93
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,791
I followed her to...
to see how she was, to help her.

94
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,000
[tense music playing]

95
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,625
And she practically collapsed in my arms.

96
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,333
And?

97
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,958
Hmm. Nothing. I held her up.

98
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,958
But a girl saw us so close together
she misinterpreted it.

99
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:23,791
What do you mean?

100
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,125
[Carlo] I don't know.

101
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,583
I don't know what she...
what she... she might have thought,

102
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,875
we were very close.

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,920
- [Margherita] When did this happen?
- Yesterday.

104
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,500
And you didn't tell me?

105
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,183
[Carlo] I didn't think it was important.

106
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,416
Then this morning, the dean
called us into his office, and so...

107
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,333
How close were you?

108
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,500
Honey, she fainted.

109
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,611
She fainted. She wasn't feeling well.
What else could I do?

110
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,125
Nothing.

111
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,710
- You don't believe me.
- [Margherita] Yeah. I do.

112
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,416
Of course.

113
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,000
And what did the dean say?

114
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,250
- Did he believe you?
- [Carlo] Yeah. He did.

115
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,750
- Did you get into trouble?
- [Carlo] No, no.

116
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,208
No. Like I said,
we, uh... we cleared it all up.

117
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,041
Okay.

118
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,541
And you?

119
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,541
What did you wanna tell me?

120
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,833
No. Nothing. I, um...

121
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,291
Just that I might be able
to close on a... a new offer.

122
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,833
- [Carlo] Hmm.
- Hmm.

123
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,625
- [Carlo] Great.
- Yep.

124
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,458
It's good. Yeah.

125
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,166
[light switch clicks]

126
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,375
[Carlo breathes deeply]

127
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,750
Are you happy?

128
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,250
What kind of question is that?

129
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,666
Of course I'm happy.

130
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,583
What's that girl's name?

131
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,750
[sighs]

132
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,791
Are you jealous?

133
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,750
[chuckles]

134
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,833
Sofia is her name.

135
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,166
Sofia Casadei.

136
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,791
Have you been talking?

137
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,458
[exhales] Come on, Marghe.

138
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,916
Do you get along with her?

139
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,333
[sighs]

140
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,375
Sweetie, nothing happened.

141
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,458
Okay?

142
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,458
I just felt
like I had to help her. That's it.

143
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,208
Really?

144
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,291
So what did you do? Did you...

145
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,833
[melancholy music playing]

146
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,041
...comfort her?

147
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,541
Hmm?

148
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,375
- Uh, well...
- Professor.

149
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,333
She seems like a very fragile girl.

150
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,541
[both breathing heavily]

151
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,875
I'm fragile too.

152
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,625
Very fragile.

Ugh. Unbelievable!

171
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,666
Obviously, we didn't take it down.

172
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,083
No. Look.

173
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,166

Of course the house is still for sale!

We'll do this. I'll fix it now.

I'll fix it, then I'll call you...
I'll call you as soon as possible. Okay?

Thanks.

177

I'll call you back soon.

178
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,625
- The owner of Concordia.
- Mrs. Di Benedetto?

179
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,708
[Eva] Someone took
the sign off the building.

It's fine. Okay. Let's fix this.

00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:49,833
Ugh.

183
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,958
What about you, honey?
How are you? Are you doing okay?

184
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,375
Yeah. Just a bit of a headache today.

185
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,458
Are you nauseous?

186
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,333
- A little bit.
- Do you have swollen feet?

187
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,166
Ugh. Eva, come on!

188
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,125
I'm not pregnant.

189
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,958
If it means that much to you,
then you get pregnant.

190
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,291
I'd rather be drowned.

191
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,515
Listen. I'll take care of the sign. Okay?

192
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,666
- [Eva] Really? Thanks, honey.
- Sure.

193
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,291
What happened
to the two people that wanted to buy it?

194
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,291
Well, they changed their mind.

195
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,750
Bummer. We almost closed it.

196
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:18,958
I know.

197
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,441
- [Eva] Okay. So you're taking care of it?
- Yep. Yeah, yeah.

198
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
[Eva] Thanks.

199
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,166
- Bye.
- Ciao.

[door opening]

202
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,583
[girl] Hi.

203
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:33,916
Whoa!

204
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,875

[cell phone chimes]

208
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:41,208
SOFIA: HI, CARLO
I'M WRITING. I NEED YOUR HELP.

209
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,875
WHEN CAN WE MEET?

210
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,375
[sighs]

211
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,125
[sighs]

212
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,916
- Hey.
- [Carlo] Hey, honey.

213
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,750
[door closes]

214
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,208
How are you?

215
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,041
Not bad.

216
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,041
I haven't cooked yet. I'm sorry.

217
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,250
It's been one of those days
where nothing gets done.

218
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,125
Don't worry about it.

219
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,125
[tense music playing]

220
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,833
[breathes deeply]

221
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,541
Hey, Hemingway.

222
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,750
Get ready. I'm taking you out.

223
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,750
Okay.

224
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,166
Wow!

225
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,916
And he just talks our ears off.
He just talks and talks and talks.

226
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,083
Just shut up, Luca! Shut up! Dammit!

227
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,208
Listen. You could invite him
to the symposium.

228
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,666
- What? Come on. You're not...
- He's the perfect guest.

229
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,583
Thanks. That's mine.

230
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,416
Well, time for a toast,

231
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,291
but I should do it now 'cause
it's our third round, so it's my turn.

232
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,416
[Carlo] What are we toasting to?

233
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,666
Let's toast to, um,

234
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,375
to the perfect crime.

235
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,916
- Oh. Is that so?
- [chuckles lightly]

236
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,166
[Carlo] Who's dead?
- No one, yet.

237
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,166
[Carlo] Mm.

238
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,333
What did you do?

239
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,666
[house music playing]

240
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,791
[indistinct chatter]

241
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,375
I took it off the market.

242
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,458
Concordia?

243
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,333
Mm-hmm.

244
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,750
I didn't sell it to them,
and I removed the ad.

245
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,708
Does the owner know?

246
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,500
- No.
- No?

247
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,833
[both laugh]

248
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,333
I know, it's crazy.

249
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,833
So, what's the plan now?

250
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:19,291
So, now the plan is
to convince the owner to lower the price

251
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,291
or the apartment will never sell.

252
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,250
And then we wait for her to lower it,

253
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,708
and when the right time comes,
we make our offer.

254
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,333
You are diabolical.

255
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,791
- You think?
- [Carlo] Yeah.

256
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,708
You're a bad, bad girl.

257
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,791
- So bad.
- Mmm.

258
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,166
We're gonna go home and deal with you.

259
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,750
Why at home?

260
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,125

[moaning]

266
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,291
- Oh!
- Oh. Sorry!

267
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,250
- Shit! No!
- [laughing]

268
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,041
No.

269
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,041
It was... it was open.

270
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,916
Oh, I can't believe it! [laughs]

271
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,666
Do you think it's normal? I mean...

272
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,125
Is it normal
to have a bathroom without a lock?

273
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,008
[Margherita] Did you see
the look on his face?

274
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,041
- Yeah. I saw it. Yeah.
- [Margherita laughing]

275
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,965
Anyway, I told you
we should've gone home, huh?

276
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,166
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

277
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,208
So, you're saying you didn't like my idea?

278
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,083
- No, no. It was a lot of fun. Yeah.
- Yeah?

279
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,750
Honey, I'm driving.

280
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,458
The last thing we need
is to get pulled over.

281
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,583
[cell phone ringing]

282
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,250
- Answer it.
- Why would she call me so late?

283
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,375
SOFIA CASADEI
ACCEPT, DECLINE

284
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,458
Answer it.

285
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,583
Hello, Sofia?

286
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,958
How are you? You okay?

287
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,500
[Sofia] <i>Yeah. I mean, I don't know.
I... I wanted to talk to you.</i>

288
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,625
Talk to me?

289
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,375
[Sofia] <i>I sent you a text. Did you see it?</i>

290
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,791
No, no. I... I didn't see it.

291
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,916
It's late. Sofia, it's almost midnight.

292
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,041
I'm in the car here with my wife,
and you're on speaker.

293
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,750
[Sofia] <i>Uh, sorry.
I didn't realize it was so late.</i>

294
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,666
All right. You can tell me
what's up tomorrow. Okay?

295
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,500
[Sofia] <i>Okay. Goodnight.</i>

296
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,583
Goodnight.

297
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,375
Stop the car.

298
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,500
- [sighs] But we're almost there.
- I said stop the car!

299

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,958
[Carlo] Where are you going?

301
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,750
Where are you go... Marghe? Where...

302
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,291
- [car door closes]
- Goddamnit!

303
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,416
[parking brake ratchets]

304
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,041

[siren wailing]

306
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,680
Marghe, what are you doing? You smoke now?

307
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,125
[Margherita] Leave me alone. Okay?

308
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,125
[Carlo] Honey, please.

309
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:31,625
I know it bothered you, but don't make
a bigger deal of this than it is.

310
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,500
"Don't make a bigger deal
than it is," Carlo?

311
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,000
You think this is normal?

312
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,803
She's calling you
at midnight and it's fine?

313
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,633
- [Carlo] You heard the call.
- Yeah. I heard.

314
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,726
Yeah. So... so you saw
that I've got nothing to hide.

315
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,000
- You told her she was on speaker. No?
- So, what?

316
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,958
It's not exactly what someone
with nothing to hide would do.

317
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,416
I wanted to make her understand
that it's late, I'm married,

318
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
and that she can't call me
whenever she wants.

319
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,333
[scoffs] What a man!

320
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,916
I can't believe
we're fighting over this shit right now.

321
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,416
She's 20, Marghe.

322
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,833
She's 20. It's okay
for her to call people this late.

323
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,226
- Really? How do you know?
- [Carlo] Yeah.

324
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,958
I don't know. I don't know. I imagine so.

325
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,416
You're so full of shit!

326
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,642
- [Carlo] Please. Let's go.
- Do you talk outside of class?

327
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,958
- [Carlo] No. We don't talk. No.
- No. But she writes to you. Texts. Calls.

328
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,767
- [Carlo] Enough!
- Are you seeing each other?

329
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,125
- [Carlo] No!
- Tell me.

330
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,750
[Carlo] We're drunk. We drank too much.

331
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:23,125
It's cold. Look. You're even shaking.
Please, let's go home. Come on.

I'm going to bed.

Are you coming?

340
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,750
What happened in that bathroom?

341
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,750
Nothing.

342
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,041
- [Margherita] Did you fuck?
- Marghe.

343
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,184
- [Margherita] Tell me.
- No.

344
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,583
We didn't fuck.

345
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,750
I told you the truth. What else can I do?

346
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,958
How can I prove to you
that nothing happened?

347
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,333
You're right. You can't.

348
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,333
Okay. I'm going.

349
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,736
What about you? You staying home?

350
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,291
I'll go to the office later.
I have an appointment at ten.

00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,791
[tense music continues]

356
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,375
[indistinct chatter]

357
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,458
Just ten minutes!
Everybody back in ten. Okay?

358
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,666
Sofia.

359
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,041
Sorry about yesterday.

360
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,500
I wanted to ask you for some advice,
but I could've waited until today.

361
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,333
But, uh, I'm not very good
at waiting it seems.

362
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,833
[Carlo] You just need
to believe in yourself more.

363
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,166
You don't need any more advice.

364
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,416
I want it from you, though.

365
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,750
I don't want things to change between us.

366
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,833
[dramatic music playing]

367
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,375
[inaudible]

368
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,208
[tense music playing]

369
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,875
I'm here for you. Always will be.

370
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,291
But you have to learn
to stand on your own two feet. Okay?

371
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:23,583
Okay.

372
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,666
Hey!

373
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,333
Everything okay?

374
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,500
- Yeah.
- [Carlo] What are you doing here?

375
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:51,666
You need to be more careful.

376
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,708
Antihistamines.

377
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,166
You always forget them.

378
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,208
You're right.

379
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,416
Luckily, I have you.

380
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,625
- [Margherita] See you tonight.
- Okay.

381
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,416
[footsteps receding]

382
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,916
[indistinct chatter]

383
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,875
[dramatic music playing]

384
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,750
[Andrea] How's it going?

385
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:57,958
Today? Bad.

386
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,375
Worse than usual.

387
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,041
Turn around.

388
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,375
[Andrea exhales]

389
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:35,708
Will massaging my back
relieve the pain in my leg?

390
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,583
You really don't trust anyone. Do you?

391
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:42,666
[exhales]

392
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,208
[Andrea] Stop thinking.

393
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:53,625
Can you do that?

394
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:55,916
No.

395
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:58,791
I can't do that.

396
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,208
I simply can't.

397
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,291
Yes. You can.

398
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,708
What did you find?

399
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,500
Oh, <i>Portraits of a Marriage.</i>

400
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,083
[Carlo] Yours or Franco's?

401
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:34,000
Franco's? Are you kidding?

402
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:37,208
He wouldn't waste a minute
on anything other than comic books.

403
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:38,291
No, no.

404
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:41,041
Márai is one of my true favorites.

405
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:45,041
"Most people don't know how to love
or how to let themselves be loved,

406
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:48,625
because they're either cowards or proud,
or because they fear failure."

407
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,958
- [chuckles] What a book. Wonderful, huh?
- [Carlo] Hmm.

408
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:55,666
- Can I ask you a question, Anna?
- [Anna] Of course.

409
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,250
Do you and Franco
tell each other everything?

410
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,291
Only the good stuff.

411
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,541
You? What do you have to say?

412
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,583
[exhales] Hmm.

413
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,666
Never noticed that stain.

414
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,583
[Anna] Oh, yes.

415
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:13,250
[chuckles] It's been there for a while.

416
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:14,625
I already called the painter.

417
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:17,583
Now I just need to empty the studio
and pack up the boxes.

418
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:18,916
If you want, I can help.

419
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,875
No, no, no.
Don't worry. I'll do it myself.

420
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:22,625
Oh. Listen, Carlo.

421
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,541
I won't be here next Thursday.

422
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:25,958
Okay.

423
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,708
- See you the Thursday after?
- Mm.

424
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:31,208
And then we can talk about
what you don't want to tell me today.

425
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,750
I don't wanna tell you anything.

426
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:33,833
[Anna chuckles]

427
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:35,958
[Carlo] Can I borrow this?

428
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,041
Of course.

429
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:39,583
But don't let Margherita know
about it. Okay?

430
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,541
'Cause if she sees you reading that book,

431
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,291
uh, it might get a little tense.

432
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,333
[both chuckle lightly]

433
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,125
- [jazz music playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

434
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,208
[Margherita] Thanks.

435
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:54,416
- Oh!
- [woman] Here she is!

436
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,041
[Margherita laughs]

437
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:58,583
- Hi!
- [woman] You look great, huh?

438
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,750
Honey, everything's amazing, really.

439
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:02,791
- Thanks.
- I'm so proud of you.

440
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:05,583
Thanks, but I can't relax just yet.

441
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,541
Oh, come on. You have to relax.
I've only heard positive things.

442
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,625
- [woman] Well, he's a genius.
- [Margherita] Yeah.

443
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:13,708
And to think he did it all
with just a ballpoint pen.

444
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:16,083
- The whole drawing...
- Giulia? Achille is here.

445
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,416
- Hi, Margherita.
- [Margherita] Hi, Alice.

446
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,583
See you later.

447
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:21,541
[Giulia] What did he say?

448
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:31,083
- [man] She looks like you.
- [Margherita] What?

449
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,208
[man] The woman in the painting.

450
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:36,625
You think?

451
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,916
He's holding her in his arms, but

452
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:41,291
she's looking elsewhere.

453
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:42,958
Like you.

454
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,625
You're here with all these people,
but you seem...

455
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,083
so distant.

456
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,750
Marcello.

457
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:53,291
[chuckles]

458
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:55,000
Margherita.

459
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,458
What do you do for a living, Margherita?

460
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,166
I'm a real estate agent.

461
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:02,583
But?

462
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:05,666
"But?"

463
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,625
[Marcello chuckles]
That look is back again.

464
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:09,166
The distant look.

465
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:13,791
I'm actually an architect, and I wanna...

466
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:17,166
I wanted to be an interior designer.

467
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,625
And why did you give it up?

468
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:22,458
Life is full of choices.

469
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,225
I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.

470
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,916
You didn't make me uncomfortable.

471
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,666
Are you here alone?

472
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:31,791
Not really. No.

473
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,083
Is he your fiancé?

474
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:39,666
Husband.

475
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,375
[chuckles]

476
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:42,541
What about you?

477
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:44,750
What do you do for a living?

478
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:47,375
And what about your dreams?
Have they all come true?

479
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:49,083
[chuckles]

480
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:50,166
I don't know.

481
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:51,750
[Alice] Margherita.

482
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,083
Let me introduce you to our artist.

483
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:55,708
Oh, well,

484
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:57,625
congratulations!

485
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,666
[Alice] I'm sorry, Marcello.
There's someone I want you to meet.

486
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,958
It's been a great pleasure
to meet you, Margherita.

487
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,000
[man] Seriously?
That's all you have to say to me?

488
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:22,958
Really? I... I can't believe it.

489
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:24,458
Unbelievable!

490
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:25,875
[Giulia] Calm down, Marco.

491
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:28,208
[Marco] This many years together.
That's all you can say?

492
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:30,958
[Giulia] Listen to me, Marco.
I can explain. Please listen to me!

493
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,916
[Marco] Do you realize
the shit I had to read?

494
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,125
I'll make you read it
sentence by sentence!

495
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,750
I took it by mistake
because it looks like mine.

496
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:41,458
But after you realized it was mine...
You shouldn't spy on me!

497
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:44,101
What the fuck are you saying?
You shouldn't have fucked that guy!

498
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:46,392
- [Giulia] That's enough.
- [Marco] It's not fucking enough!

499
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:47,976
- Tell me where...
- [Giulia] Keep it down!

500
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,476
- [Marco] Why'd you do it?
- [Giulia] 'Cause you're stuck, Marco.

501
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,291
We're stuck. We had plans,
but we're not going anywhere!

502
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,458
Hmm?

503
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:58,166
You're a bitch. You know that?

504
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,208
Yep.

505
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:03,625
But you know I'm right.

506
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:06,541
I have to go now.

507
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,083
That's crazy.

508
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:18,791
Yeah. It's crazy.

509
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:20,625
Hmm.

510
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,416
From the Maldives to divorce.

511
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:26,250
What a nice change of plans, huh?

512
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:27,625
Oh, come on, Carlo. Stop it.

513
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:30,125
How can you joke about this?
I'm really shocked!

514
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:34,500
I mean, how did she
hide everything for six months?

515
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,458
She didn't say anything to me,
and I didn't notice anything.

516
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:44,166
Why did you stop in and see me at school?

517
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:55,458
What can I do to make you feel better
about things between us?

518
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:57,041
[tense music playing]

519
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:00,375
I don't know.

520
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:28,291
[bus door closes]

521
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,958
[bus squeals]

522
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:37,666
[cell phone ringing]

523
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,250
Papa?

524
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:43,011
<i>- </i>[father] <i>Hi! How are you?</i>
- [bell chiming]

525
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:44,750
I can't hear you!

526
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,583
[father] <i>How are you?</i>

527
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,208
Oh, I'm doing well.

528
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:49,750
[father] <i>Hmm. Are you sure?</i>

529
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,666
Yeah. Why do you ask? Why wouldn't I be?

530
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:55,708
[father] <i>Come on. Tell me.</i>

No, no, no. We've just opened.

[Margherita] Thanks.

00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:27,916
[man] What can I get you?

555
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,625
We can do a coffee or a smoothie?

556
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,083
[Margherita] A smoothie, please.

557
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:35,166
[man] Perfect.
Uh, apple, pineapple, and ginger?

558
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,583

- [man] Right away.

560
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:53,458
Yes?

561
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:54,750
Have I met you before?

562
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,041
You know who I am.

563
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:00,333
How can I help you today?

564
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,875
I'd like to talk to you for a minute,
if that's okay.

565
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,750
Sure.

566
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,208
I'd like to hear your version.

Well, my version's the same
as the, uh... the professor's is.

571
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:28,375
I wasn't feeling well.
I went to the bathroom, and he helped me.

572
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:29,958
And then?

573
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:32,625
And then nothing.
Someone saw us and misunderstood it.

574
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:34,833
And is there a reason to misunderstand it?

575
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:36,250
Is this an interrogation?

00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:38,916
I'm sorry.

578
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:42,250
You're right,
it does kinda seem like an interrogation.

579
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,458
It's just that Carlo and I
have been together for years,

580
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:48,916
and, um, we have plans for the future,

581
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,125
and I... I have to know the truth.

582
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:53,458
I just told you everything
that I have to say.

[Margherita] What you have to say
or what you wanna say?

584
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:01,750
In this case, there's no difference.

585

when you called him at midnight?

[Sofia] I didn't realize it was so late.

00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:11,041
I was, uh, writing a story,

00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,666

00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:23,666

Does he have feelings for you?

599
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:47,791
No.
