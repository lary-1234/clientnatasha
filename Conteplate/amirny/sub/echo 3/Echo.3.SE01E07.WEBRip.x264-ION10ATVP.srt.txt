0
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,509
Hey.

1
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,593
Hey, man.

2
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,720
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

3
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,681
All good. Put them there. Right there.

4
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,604
Yeah.
Prince said he called for reinforcements.

5
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,395
- Yeah, just here to help out.
- Welcome to hell, brother.

6
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,067
How's our boy?

7
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,903
Yeah. I think he wants to stay with us.

8
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,925
Fuck.

9
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,303
- You want some?
- Yeah.

10
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:38,932
All right.

11
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:42,936
Your brother seems to want you back.
Can we trust him?

12
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,730
All I know is…

13
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,483
Tariq is not gonna lift a finger
to save me. Okay?

14
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,320
This will be another way
that I have embarrassed him,

15
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,483
and you don't know him, you know?
You don't know him.

16
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,283
He's not a good person.
He's a piece of shit.

17
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,577
So, you have to take me back, okay?

18
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,955
Just... I swear.
Just take me back and I forget you.

19
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,499
I ever... I have money.
I have a lot of money.

20
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,061
If you want money, I have a lot of money,
bro. Please, no, don't!

21
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,881
No!

22
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:15,469
No!

23
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,682
Fuck!

24
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,480
How long we gonna wait

25
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,440
- for this fucking call?
- They'll call.

26
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,444
We've been here all day, Eric.

27
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,656
And what he told me, I…

28
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,494
Tariq will call.

29
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,954
All right.

30
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,316
Hey, Roy. Morning. Wakey-wakey.

31
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,076
Hey, man. Come on. Just get up.

32
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,539
Oh, God.

33
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,350
It's taking too long, man.
Something's wrong.

34
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,687
Just saying,
Tariq would have called by now.

35
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,190
He knows we have his brother.

36
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,153
I'd say this plan is clearly not working.

37
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,571
He ain't playing, man.

38
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:42,491
Just because it's taking longer
doesn't mean it's not working.

39
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,786
He wants his brother back, trust me.

40
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,206
You guys are all over Twitter.

41
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,170
Shit.

42
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,891
Hi.

43
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:32,726
Hi.

44
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,809
How are you?

45
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,147
Fine.

46
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,319
Can we please talk?

47
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,838
Why are you here?

48
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,005
Sorry?

49
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,843
Why aren't you at work?

50
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,722
Is Gloria okay?

51
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:12,682
Yes.

52
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,019
I just dropped her off at school.

53
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,272
I came back to get some documents.

54
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,315
Okay.

55
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,236
She's also worried about you, you know.

56
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,075
I am not going to pretend

57
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,121
- that I understand what you went through.
- No.

58
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,248
I appreciate that.

59
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,374
But…

60
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,296
can you help me understand?

61
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,840
I'm not a psychiatrist.

62
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,551
But I am your husband and I love you.

63
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,730
- Violeta.
- What?

64
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,653
Look, I'm glad we're finally
talking about this.

65
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,532
I spoke to the General.
He explained everything to me.

66
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,498
What is that?

67
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,253
Where are you going?

68
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,547
To work.

69
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,757
To work?

70
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,013
You've barely said 10 words to me
or your daughter since you got back.

71
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,265
You were in a firefight
and almost got killed.

72
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,518
But you don't want my help,

73
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,453
you won't talk to anyone,
you won't see a therapist.

74
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,645
Look, your American friends.

75
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:38,745
Ms. Matíz, I have read
your articles with great interest.

76
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,749
It was very brave of you
to help that American woman.

77
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,546
I don't know
that I could have done the same.

78
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:51,425
We had hoped for
a different outcome. I'm not that brave.

79
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:56,054
In this office
we all think you were very brave.

80
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,432
Ms. Matíz, it's an honor, truly.

81
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,934
The President is waiting for you inside.

82
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,357
Violeta Matíz.

83
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:08,858
Nice to see you again.

84
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,445
Mr. President, thank you for having me
on such short notice.

85
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,047
I have been looking forward to seeing you.

86
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,448
This way, please.

87
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,326
Now, let me say, first

88
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,536
that despite our best efforts,
there are still those

89
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,080
in our country who would perpetuate
this kind of violence.

90
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,436
I will be the first to admit,
if something had happened to you

91
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,604
it would have been a tragedy.

92
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,708
You are the most important journalist
in the country.

93
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,632
Thank you very much, sir.

94
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:35,052
A lot of young Colombian women admire
and look up to you.

95
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,680
Too bad our political views
are not completely in sync.

96
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,934
You're not exactly a supporter
of my party.

97
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,436
My personal political beliefs
are irrelevant, sir.

98
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,563
Yes, of course, you're objective.

99
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,127
In fact, that's what I'm counting on,
an objective observation.

100
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,317
That is the job.

101
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,362
So, what can I help you with?

102
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,907
There's a story I have been working on
for The Times

103
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,825
and I would like your opinion about it.

104
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,453
It's about the kidnapping in Medellín.

105
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,248
It's likely that Americans were behind it.

106
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,167
Here are some images

107
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,419
from the surveillance cameras
at the stadium.

108
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:11,797
I know who they are.

109
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,298
I had one of them on my show.

110
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,677
They're U.S. Special Forces.

111
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,347
Yes, this is being investigated.

112
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,643
My guess is that if I have access
to these images

113
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,479
the intelligence services
must have briefed you.

114
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:31,525
Did you give the DNI any special
instructions on how to handle them?

115
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,318
Sir, why weren't they arrested?

116
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,279
Why haven't they been questioned at least?

117
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,115
You know I can't speak about an
ongoing investigation.

118
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,200
If you'll excuse me.

119
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,637
My aide will put you in touch with
somebody from the military

120
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,872
who can answer any further questions
or concerns.

121
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,331
Yes, of course.

122
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,917
Now, there's a small matter
that needs my attention.

123
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,544
Thank you very much for your time.

124
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,087
- Nice to see you.
- Excuse me.

125
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,262
- Times. Lindgren.
- Hey. It's Violeta.

126
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,931
Hey, V. What's up?

127
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:05,767
The president was evasive.
That's to be expected.

128
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,394
Well, yes, I suppose.

129
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,271
At this point, I am almost certain

130
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,565
the CIA is involved with these guys.

131
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:17,654
I mean, how else will you explain
why they are not being arrested?

132
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:22,826
What I still don't know
is where my country pans out in this.

133
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:24,620
Are they helping or not?

134
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,706
I have to admit…

135
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,751
I'm afraid we're slipping back in time

136
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,754
to when the US
did whatever they wanted to in Colombia.

137
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,090
Yeah, well, you may be on to something.

138
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,261
There may be dangerous times ahead,
but you just keep digging, okay?

139
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,305
Hang in there, champ.

140
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,422
The famous Violeta Matíz.

141
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,175
You've been busy lately.

142
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,594
Are you tracking me?

143
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,722
I don't track you.

144
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,603
We get reports from the Colombian side.
They track the shit out of you.

145
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,650
I'm writing about the American SF guys.

146
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:41,572
I know them,
and I know what they're doing.

147
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,033
That sounds like an interesting story.

148
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,619
Yeah. It is.

149
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,792
They have help.

150
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:58,881
It's you, right?

151
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:07,389
Yeah. It's you.

152
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,851
Hey. So where we at?

153
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,102
Still waiting.

154
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:14,595
You decided what you wanna do?

155
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,107
We can't do that here.
We need to be more remote.

156
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:18,233
I'll make it happen.

157
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:19,735
Copy that.

158
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:28,577
Listen, slight complication.
Your mother-in-law's here.

159
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,745
What?

160
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,083
Give your mama some sugar.

161
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:40,255
Why are you here?

162
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,468
Well, you know, that's just what I said
to you when you were born.

163
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,512
But you turned out all right.

164
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:50,682
I'm sorry, Mom, but...
Listen, I don't understand.

165
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:56,188
What's to understand, son? You're here,
Amber's here, my son-in-law is here.

166
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:59,399
When y'all left we were family.
That hasn't changed, right?

167
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,068
Right.

168
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,404
Hey, don't worry about me, son,
I can be useful.

169
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:06,615
I know, Mom.

170
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:10,661
I'm just saying, it'd be nice if
you gave me a little heads-up, that's all.

171
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,704
I texted you, didn't I?

172
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:16,750
Jesus, everybody but me
needs to be coddled all the time.

173
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:19,169
Thank you.

174
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,100
Okay.

175
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,269
- This is home.
- Okay.

176
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,860
- Hi, Maggie.
- Hi.

177
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,324
Come here.

178
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,418
Hi.

179
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,295
Roy, this is my mother-in-law,

180
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,838
Margaret Chesborough. Mom, Roy.

181
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,174
- Hi.
- Extremely charmed to meet you, ma'am.

182
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,425
Roy works with Eric.

183
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,761
You must be thirsty.
Can I get you a drink?

184
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:13,765
I suppose I would take a beer.
If it's not too much trouble.

185
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:17,394
- And one for my son too.
- No, thank you. I'm on the wagon.

186
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,106
Good for you, buster.

187
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:23,734
It won't last.

188
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,867
- Would you like a glass?
- Thank you. No, this is great.

189
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:34,745
Right. Perfect.

190
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:43,170
Well, cheers, boys.

191
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:44,796
Cheers.

192
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,051
Oh, man.

193
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,222
All right. Bathroom's on the left.

194
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,058
There's a bad guy
tied up in the bedroom on the right.

195
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,269
This is our bedroom.
This is where we're gonna sleep.

196
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,358
What's all this?

197
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:07,903
It's a small arsenal.

198
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,364
What are you planning, son?

199
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:19,705
Amber was taken to a black site
facility near the border of Venezuela.

200
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,417
I tracked her there but

201
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:28,339
it was very heavily guarded,
and a straight-up extraction is tricky.

202
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,801
And the CIA isn't gonna help.

203
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,262
Well, there's a fucking surprise.

204
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,098
But Prince did find out

205
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:39,852
that the guy that runs the prison system
in Venezuela has a younger brother.

206
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,605
So, we grabbed him and brought him here.

207
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,483
Straight-up hostage swap, then?

208
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,194
Yeah.

209
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,657
Then why all the hardware?
That your plan B?

210
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,410
No, plan B is something else.

211
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:01,999
Look, Mom, I...

212
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,584
I gotta go run a little errand.

213
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,667
You gonna be okay?

214
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,920
Yeah. I need a little rest anyway.

215
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:11,884
Yeah, course. It's a long trip.
You must be tired. All right.

216
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,093
Thank you.

217
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:16,555
Prince?

218
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,225
Hey, Roy. You seen Prince?

219
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:21,518
Yeah, he left already.

220
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,020
All right.

221
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:26,190
I'll see you later.

222
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,274
Okay.

223
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,489
You fancy watching some rugby?

224
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,085
Go, go, go! There we go.

225
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:48,712
There you go. Yes!

226
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:51,798
That's a try. Like a touchdown.

227
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:56,428
My team's playing after this game.
The All Blacks.

228
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:58,263
They're all Black?

229
00:18:58,347 --> 00:18:59,932
No, we wear the black jerseys.

230
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,642
- From New Zealand.
- Okay.

231
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,435
But these guys are tough.

232
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,147
Very good.

233
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,399
…Argentinean defense. Here they go again.

234
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,235
Goes short to Samu that time, Beale.

235
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,279
On they come, Argentina.
There's Tupou making another tackle.

236
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:15,197
Cleaned up by…

237
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,910
You know, I think I'm gonna go freshen up.

238
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,162
- Yeah. You go. I'll be here.
- All right.

239
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:24,414
…having a chat with Jaco Peyper is all.

240
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:27,501
That's going on. Boffelli says,
"Look, skit, I'll whip through the three."

241
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,545
We're off to the sheds.

242
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:34,967
And at the break, the Wallabies
lead Argentina 15 points to 3.

243
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:41,765
Slipper looking to Tupou,
then going himself.

244
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:03,954
How you doing?

245
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,332
Okey dokey.

246
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:10,854
Bang.

247
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:26,995
I'm gon' take a bath.

248
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,289
Enjoy!

249
00:21:56,483 --> 00:22:00,112
Dragged down on the tackle of Mapimpi.
But it's there for Perenara.

250
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:03,115
Change of tactics from Beauden Barrett.

251
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:19,840
Take the kick, take the kick.

252
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:32,436
…this match
have come from tries and conversions.

253
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:36,773
The Springboks, 49% of their points
have been coming from penalty goals.

254
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:38,483
So that says it all really.

255
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:47,201
Just over ten minutes remaining.
And there's been a fair bit of space.

256
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:48,284
I...

257
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:35,767
Fuck.

258
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:01,793
Hey, Mom.

259
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:06,673
Goddamn great beer they have
in this country. It's just delicious.

260
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:08,717
Yeah.

261
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:12,053
Mom.

262
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:18,185
You wanna tell me what happened here?

263
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:32,658
What happened?

264
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:36,787
I killed a guy.

265
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:43,210
Mom. I'm sending you home.

266
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:48,756
Plan B.

267
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:32,801
I always wanted his nod.
You know, respect.

268
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:36,555
Maybe more than my old man.

269
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:42,769
He was fucking stingy with that. You know?

270
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:45,731
He had family?

271
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,610
Me and my dad were his family.

272
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:59,453
He loved Amber.
He treated me differently after her.

273
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:06,251
Like, kid's a man now. He finally found
a woman who will put up with him.

274
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:09,713
Then he died for her.

275
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:27,439
Then he died for her.

276
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,819
Well, this isn't over, man.

277
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,113
More people are gonna die.

278
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:49,169
Hi, Hugo. What's up?

279
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,880
Listen, V. I hate to make this call,

280
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:54,466
- but we can't publish your story.
- What?

281
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,093
You wrote an incredible piece.

282
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,096
Obviously,
we think you're an amazing journalist.

283
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:01,348
- Are you kidding me? Who killed it?
- The truth? I don't know.

284
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,016
No, tell me. Who killed it?

285
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,270
Publisher wouldn't tell me.
Did you poke the CIA?

286
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:07,688
Fuck.

287
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:10,190
I'm sorry. Good luck. Okay?

288
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:16,697
Fuck.

289
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,600
All right, buddy.

290
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:28,268
Step down.

291
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:10,884
Hi.

292
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:13,971
- What do we have so far?
- Nothing.

293
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:26,483
This ain't the Four Seasons,
I can tell you that.

294
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:32,531
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

295
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:36,243
You're gonna need to hear this.
Everyone is right where we want them.

296
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:39,514
Tariq is on edge 'cause he knows
we're serious, and we have his brother.

297
00:34:39,538 --> 00:34:41,998
Now, this shouldn't take much.
Use a light touch.

298
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,543
I ain't doing any of it. You're the pro.

299
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,940
Don't believe everything you hear, man.

300
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:52,777
Especially when it's coming from
other people at the Agency

301
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:54,844
who are just trying to cover
their own asses.

302
00:34:56,722 --> 00:34:59,016
Right. Well, let's just get it over with,
shall we?

303
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:01,435
- How's this?
- This is perfect.

304
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:04,229
I'll call Tariq. You get him warmed up.

305
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,463
- Hello.
- Listen, I got your brother nearby.

306
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:31,226
He wants to talk to you.
Wanna talk to him?

307
00:35:36,637 --> 00:35:37,846
Here's what I'm gonna do.

308
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:43,268
I'm gonna set the phone down right here.

309
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:45,896
I tried to simplify this for you,
my brother.

310
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:46,980
What's going on?

311
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:48,857
Hello?

312
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:50,859
Hello?

313
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:00,908
Where the fuck's he going?

314
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:23,308
All right.

315
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:25,477
This is going the wrong way, Tariq.

316
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:27,521
Three of your men are dead.

317
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:29,773
I hope you're proud of yourself.

318
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:33,527
Kidnapping a harmless puppy
like my brother and then torturing him.

319
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:36,655
Is this what they teach you
in your Special Forces?

320
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:38,532
What you should be concerned about

321
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:40,868
is that this is only the beginning
of what they teach us.

322
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:43,370
Either way, it will do you no good.

323
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:46,456
As far as Amber is concerned,
my hands are tied.

324
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,210
- The decision is over my head now.
- Bullshit.

325
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:54,047
You control the prisons,
you control the facility.

326
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:58,177
You're Maduro's second in command.
Everyone knows it. You can let her go.

327
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:02,389
You're wrong. You're hurting
an innocent man for nothing.

328
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:04,053
We're just getting started.

329
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:06,602
I need you to agree

330
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:08,979
to let Amber go
or this is gonna get far worse.

331
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,773
- Momo.
- Tariq!

332
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:13,775
- Brother. Please.
- Momo.

333
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:15,611
This is serious, brother.

334
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:16,862
They are animals.

335
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:18,530
I don't think you get it.

336
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:22,910
If I attach this wire, he's ruined.
You understand what that means?

337
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:26,580
This is pointless. Don't you think
I would release her if I could?

338
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:28,415
She means nothing to me at all.

339
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:33,212
But I cannot help her
because your wife was spying for the CIA.

340
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:36,423
Part of their new school
of the America's program.

341
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:40,427
You can pretend all you want,
but you know this is true.

342
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:44,348
My brother.
My brother is a foolish performer

343
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,725
- whose family has disowned him.
- No, no, no.

344
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:52,356
I'm not the villain in this story, Eric.
You are.

345
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:55,400
You have no idea
how much of a villain I can be.

346
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:58,570
Tell me you'll let her go.

347
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:01,907
No, I will not let her go…

348
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,617
- Please!
- …because I don't wish to.

349
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,287
- Please, brother.
- Momo. Momo!

350
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:09,665
This is happening
because you are a traitor.

351
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:11,208
I am not a traitor.

352
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,335
I have always been loyal to you
and to the regime.

353
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:17,005
Please help me, forgive me.

354
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:18,632
What the fuck do you want, huh?

355
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:22,761
For the government and your brother
to save your ass?

356
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:24,221
Is that what you want?

357
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:25,305
Well, no.

358
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:28,642
As far as I'm concerned,
they can kill you like a dog.

359
00:38:29,226 --> 00:38:30,936
I don't care how much you hate him.

360
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:34,147
He's still your brother.
You think I don't know what that means?

361
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:39,862
I think that like every spoiled American,
you think that everyone is just like you.

362
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:43,448
Don't test me! That's a mistake.
I know what I am.

363
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:48,412
And I know what you are too, Eric.
A rich, arrogant boy.

364
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:52,499
Had you come to me with just
a small amount of humility or respect,

365
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:55,586
this could be different.
But you are all the same.

366
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,047
You think you can frighten us
into doing anything you want?

367
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:05,345
But now, Amber is going to rot
in that prison

368
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:07,431
for the rest of her life.

369
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:11,435
And I will double, triple
my forces surrounding it.

370
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,937
And I will let them do
whatever they wish to her,

371
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:17,357
until she will be unrecognizable.

372
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,322
I'm not testing you, Eric.
I'm beating you.

373
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:27,367
I will torture him, then I will kill him.

374
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:31,371
And then, then I'll come for you.

375
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:38,003
Yeah, and I will leave the door open.

376
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:41,924
- No, no.
- Is this what you want, you motherfucker?

377
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:44,092
Please, don't.

378
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:47,221
- Eric!
- What?

379
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:52,184
Momo.

380
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:54,269
Momo.

381
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:32,724
It's all right.

382
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,144
You're gonna be fine.

383
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:04,173
- Well, that didn't work.
- Nope.

384
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:07,009
Well, we got here eventually.

385
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:09,178
I guess we go to war, then.

386
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:11,054
Yep.

387
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:34,513
I know you can do it.

388
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:38,767
You can jam comms from that black site
back to the Venezuelan army.

389
00:42:39,518 --> 00:42:41,562
Just scramble the radio for two hours.

390
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:43,605
First, I wanna talk about Medellín.

391
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:46,733
Please don't tell me
that Mitch did that to help you.

392
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:48,235
Why else would he do it?

393
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:53,574
Do you really think
that a guy at his level,

394
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:55,409
just below the seventh floor,

395
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:57,452
comes down here
to help you with a kidnapping?

396
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:01,540
Who did you kidnap?

397
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:04,668
The brother of a minister
who runs a black site, sure,

398
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:08,130
but that's not all.
What else does he control?

399
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,842
He's got his fingers in the military,
the presidency.

400
00:43:13,677 --> 00:43:15,179
Think about the bigger picture.

401
00:43:19,558 --> 00:43:20,559
Come on, let's walk.

402
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:27,900
I'm gonna hit this facility,

403
00:43:28,525 --> 00:43:31,862
and I need you to jam their satellites
and slow down the VZ air support.

404
00:43:32,362 --> 00:43:33,363
I need two hours.

405
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,533
But what would it achieve?

406
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:39,828
- I'd get her out.
- What else?

407
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:41,330
What is Mitch doing here?

408
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:44,917
And what will it serve
if you jack up that minister?

409
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,418
If you do a cross-border raid?

410
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:48,670
Think about the history.

411
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:51,507
Go back 50 years.

412
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:59,932
United States Objectives and Programs
for National Security, NSC 68.

413
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:02,643
The document that President Truman signed

414
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:05,896
made rolling back communism
the single highest priority.

415
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:10,692
I mean,
can you imagine how fucking hard that is?

416
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,280
Replacing left-wing leaders
with right-wingers.

417
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:20,327
Military takeovers. Coups.
Protect American business interests.

418
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,873
I mean, do you understand
how invested we are down here?

419
00:44:25,374 --> 00:44:26,750
It's a lifetime commitment.

420
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:34,132
We're the ones who did Argentina, Bolivia,
Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba,

421
00:44:34,216 --> 00:44:38,971
Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Nicaragua,
Paraguay, Panama and Venezuela.

422
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:44,309
The CIA's number one client is the CIA.
Never forget that.

423
00:44:45,435 --> 00:44:48,730
Mitch wants a war. The agency needs one,

424
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:50,792
- and you're gonna give it to them.
- I don't care.

425
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:52,496
They don't give a shit if you live or die.

426
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:55,571
We're gonna
do this cross-border operation.

427
00:44:56,405 --> 00:44:57,906
We're gonna hit their black site.

428
00:44:59,408 --> 00:45:01,702
Fuck up the cocaine, steal a prisoner.

429
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:05,414
It's an instigation.
The Venezuelans will overreact.

430
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:07,624
They'll hit Colombia,

431
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:11,503
and it'll spiral
into a low-intensity conflict.

432
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:13,672
Pretty soon, it's a war.

433
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:16,884
I don't give a fuck.
I'm pretty good at war.

434
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:22,973
And how many Venezuelan lives
are you willing to trade for your sister?

435
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,185
I don't know.
How many you got? A million?

436
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:32,482
- It was a shitty question.
- Yeah.

437
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:35,485
I'm sorry for the lecture.

438
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:39,156
I just needed to know
that you were self-aware.

439
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:46,747
Listen, I'm not officially
part of Mitch's program,

440
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,750
so I haven't been read into everything
you've been doing for him.

441
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:51,543
But I have a job.

442
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:57,591
My op is a hostage rescue for my wife,
and take down a black site.

443
00:45:57,674 --> 00:45:59,551
- It's complicated and dangerous…
- Okay.

444
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:01,803
…but it pays very well.

445
00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:03,931
Need about 20 men total.

446
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:06,016
Now, how well do you men know the border?

447
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:09,144
Well enough to know
if we are doing something on their side.

448
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:12,105
The Venezuelan army
will be problem if they come.

449
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:14,650
Are you gonna give me the two hours?

450
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:17,361
No. The best I can do is 48 minutes.

451
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:19,738
Forty-eight minutes.

452
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:25,410
You have 48 minutes before
Caracas receives word you're attacking.

453
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:29,498
Forty-eight minutes?
That's the best you can do?

454
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:31,959
You gotta give me more time.

455
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:35,003
In 1970
on the way home from the moon landing,

456
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:38,382
an oxygen tank blew up
on the Apollo spacecraft.

457
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:42,344
The crew found themselves
60 miles off course from planet Earth.

458
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:44,972
They were hurtling toward destruction.

459
00:46:45,055 --> 00:46:47,641
Power was out.
They had no navigation equipment.

460
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:53,105
When they calculated the fuel burn
to readjust their flight path,

461
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:57,734
it came out to 14 seconds of burn time.

462
00:47:01,154 --> 00:47:03,282
They had 14 seconds to save themselves.

463
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:10,706
Good luck.

464
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:17,504
Ten, nine, eight.
Ignition sequence has started.

465
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:23,677
Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.

466
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:27,306
We have commit,
and we have liftoff at two-thirteen.

467
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:32,227
The Saturn V building up
to 7.6 million pounds of thrust,

468
00:47:32,311 --> 00:47:34,479
and it has cleared the...
cleared the tower.
