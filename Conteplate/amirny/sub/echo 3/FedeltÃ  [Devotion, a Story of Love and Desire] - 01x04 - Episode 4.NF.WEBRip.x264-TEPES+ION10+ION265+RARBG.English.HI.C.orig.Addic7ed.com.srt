Franco.

183
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:25,833
[Carlo sighs]

184
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,958
Maybe it was...
Well, I don't know, nothing romantic.

185
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,500
He had a relationship with her.

186
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,583
They wrote to each other for years.

187
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,125
My father was having an affair...

188
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,625
and I didn't know about it.

189
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:42,708
[scoffs]

190
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,208
I'm so sorry.

191
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,583
I don't know
how I'm gonna tell my mom about it.

192
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,125
I mean, it was such a long time ago.

193
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,208
You father's passed on.

194
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,708
Maybe you shouldn't.

195
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,208
[Margherita inhales, exhales]

196
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,541
Doesn't she have a right to know?

197
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:05,958
[Carlo sighs]

198
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,875
Let's go out tonight. Huh?

199
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,998
- I think that you can really use a break.
- [sighs]

200
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:11,958
Hmm?

201
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,125
Okay.

202
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,250
[Marco] If only it was that easy.

203
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,125
[Giulia] I'm not saying that it's easy.

204
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,041
- [jazz music playing]
- Sure. Hey!

205
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,892
- [Giulia] Hi.
- [Margherita] Hey.

206
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,236
[Marco] You guys here for dinner?

207
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,583
Yeah. Uh, we were just gonna grab a table.

208
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,750
What? No. Sit with us.

209
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,875
- No.
- [Carlo] We don't want to interrupt.

210
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,375
Are you kidding? Come on, sit.
I'll get you some wine.

211
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,125
Uh, Beppe?
Can we get two more glasses of the red?

212
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,208
Thank you.

213
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,868
[Carlo] Well, how's it going?

214
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,625
I was just reminiscing here with Giulia.

215
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,958
We were talking
about our first date, actually.

216
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,708
Where was your first date?

217
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,750
It was at a Thai place.

218
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,791
I asked Marghe
what she wanted for dinner, and she said,

219
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:04,708
"Ethnic food."

220
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,875
So, I decided I was gonna surprise her
and take her out for Thai.

221
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,250
How was it?

222
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,166
Disgusting.

223
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,250
[all laughing]

224
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,791
But I lied and said Thai was my favorite.

225
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,750
Huh. She's never told me that.

226
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,583
[Giulia] You two are amazing.

227
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,791
You're always discovering
new things about each other.

228
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,583
- [Carlo chuckles]
- Well, that's not always a positive thing.

229
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,083
You're right. One, zero.

230
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,250
All I'm saying
is that you two are a very strong couple.

231
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,291
We came here on our first date,

232
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,291
and now it's our place.

233
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,041
I mean, that is the reason
that I bought it, was for us.

234
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:36,958
Now it's two, zero.

235
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:42,291
That's not all. On our first date,
we also went to a Cezanne exhibition.

236
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,666
[laughs]

237
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,833
Uh, well, I pretended
I knew everything about the art, and all,

238
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:50,041
because it was our first date
and I wanted to win her over.

239
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,958
- And I immediately knew.
- You didn't buy it.

240
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,333
Not even for a minute.

241
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,416
But I still dragged him
to every exhibition that I could find

242
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,958
just to see how much he cared about me.

243
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,625
Hmm. No.

244
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,583
That was just the work of a cynical woman,

245
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:06,125
who always gets whatever she wants
by cruelly exercising her power.

246
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,041
Three, zero.

247
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,833
You're right. I am cynical.

248
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,333
Or maybe I was cynical.

249
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,625
But now, after the mistakes I've made,

250
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:21,000
I realized that, actually,
cynicism is a way to hide that

251
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,333
you really feel pathetic.

252
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,083
Three to one?

253
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,041
I guess. Three to one. Yeah.

254
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,005
[Carlo] Let's toast.
You have catching up to do.

255
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,458
Drink, drink. We got this. Drink!

256
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,541
[chuckles]

257
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,750
They sure have quite the stories,
don't they?

258
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,208
[motorcycle engine revving]

259
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,125
[indistinct chatter]

260
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,083
I'm sorry. I was hoping
this would distract you for a bit.

261
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,250
[sighs] It wasn't a good night for this.

262
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,166
[sniffles]

263
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,375
But it's hard to be distracted
when everything's falling apart. You know?

264
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,041
[Carlo] Come on.
Don't blow this out of proportion.

265
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,351
Franco and Anna
were married right to the end. All right?

266
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,125
So, they must have been happy together.

267
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,708
Sure. By hiding the truth
from one another.

268
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,583
Oh, what do we know
about what they did or didn't hide?

269
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,708
I can't do this anymore, Carlo. I mean it.

270
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,541
I can't keep pretending everything's fine,

271
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,041
and that we're the happiest couple
in the world and...

272
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,245
- [Carlo] What's that got to do with this?
- You do whatever you want. And I...

273
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,541
And you? What is it?

274
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,541
I've thought about you,
and you alone, for five years.

275
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,291
"Will he ever get his book done?"

276
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,916
"Does he have enough space to work?"

277
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
"How can I be more supportive to Carlo?"

278
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,541
"Is he comfortable?"

279
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,291
And anything that mattered to me,

280
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:42,166
all of the goals, ambitions, or plans,
they get pushed aside for you.

281
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,291
Then I wake up one morning

282
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,934
and find you'd rather be
with some 20-year-old kid instead of me.

283
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,250
- Let that go!
- [Margherita] And I've done nothing wrong!

284
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,333
Marghe, some 20-year-old
isn't taking your place!

285
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,375
My God. Admit it, Carlo.

286
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,750
You know what this is?

287
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:58,041
I think you're still upset
because of that crazy misunderstanding.

288
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,333
Just drop it, Marghe!

289
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,125
Not everything is about you,
but you always think it is.

290
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,250
You're fucking selfish,
self-referencing, self-centered,

291
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,041
really any word that begins with "self."

292
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,725
You choose which one. You're the writer!

293
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,500
The real misunderstanding is you and me.

294
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:13,583
[scoffs]

295
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,541
[melancholy music playing]

296
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,250
[indistinct chatter]

297
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,750
[Luca] There he is!

298
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,750
Did you come to see some real writers?

299
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,500
Because we have quite the lineup.

300
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,708
[sighs] Luca, I am not in the mood
to be lectured by you today.

301
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,000
- Do you wanna get a coffee?
- I'm on my fifth one.

302
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,625
No better drug around.

303
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,291
Shit! I forgot my wallet.

304
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,625
Really? That old excuse?

305
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,541
[Carlo] Oh, come on. Just buy me a coffee.

306
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,875
Anyway, you're right.
It's been pretty hard.

307
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,041
I've been distracted.

308
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,708
Yeah. You look like shit,
now that you point it out.

309
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,291
I've been on the couch for two nights.

310
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,958
Whose choice was that? Tell me.

311
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,291
[Carlo] Doesn't matter.

312
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,625
I have been writing, though.

313
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,708
[Luca] Good!

314
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,750
Maybe you need some chaos. Okay?

315
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,666
I mean, what if you created the mess
to inspire your writing?

316
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,208
That your new pickup line?

317
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,875
You're a psychotherapist now? Come on.

318
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,083
[Luca chuckles]

319
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,375
Look. I wish I knew what to say,

320
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,458
but I don't.

321
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:27,375
I mean, getting married?
No. Other people can do that.

322
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,583
Your block is when?

323
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,416
In one hour. Just down the hallway.

324
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,166
Well, we'd better go see
who's stealing my thunder.

325
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,625
Oh.

326
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,583
Wanna sniff out the competition, huh?

327
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:38,916
- Hmm.
- Come with me.

328
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,625
[Luca chuckles]

329
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,875
My desire...

330
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,458
It was actually quite bold,

331
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,208
my magnificent desire.

332
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,875
I think that's what's lead me
through the streets of my life,

333
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,583
and through my pages too.

334
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,875
This desire to do something different,

335
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,583
and this deep desire I had

336
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,875
to forge a new path.

337
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,166
- I don't know where the desire comes from...
- Look at that guy.

338
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,500
That big-headed asshole's
already sold a million copies.

339
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,291
- I hate to admit it, but he's pretty good.
- [Luca] He is.

340
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,958
[man]... would pull me out of class.

341
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:12,708
He'd take me to the beach or to the park,
and we'd spend entire days

342
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:16,458
imagining worlds
of elves and fairies dancing in the wind.

343
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,208
[dramatic music playing]

344
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,583
So there she is.
That's who you're talking about.

345
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,666
- Hey.
- I mean, she is very beautiful.

346
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,625
[man] ...I've thought about them often.

347
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:30,708
I love this rhetoric,
the rhetoric of desire.

348
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,250
[girl] That man's great.

349
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,000
- See you later, then, Carlo. Yeah.
- [Carlo] See you.

350
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,333
- See you later, professor.
- [Carlo] See you later.

351
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,541
Open bar?

352
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,545
[Carlo] There is,
but don't overdo it. I mean it.
