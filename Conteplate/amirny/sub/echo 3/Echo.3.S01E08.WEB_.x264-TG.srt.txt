1
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:34,512
Who is it?

2
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,723
It's your brother.

3
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:01,790
Look, I left this shitty place.

4
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:04,584
And I have worked
hard to make my music.

5
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:07,587
To be an artist, to have
nothing to do with you.

6
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,591
And then two fucking
psychopaths come out of nowhere.

7
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:14,844
They kidnap me, drug
me, and torture me.

8
00:02:16,388 --> 00:02:18,056
All because of you, asshole.

9
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,975
You didn't do shit!

10
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:22,060
I sent some people

11
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:24,229
but they were killed.

12
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:28,400
And if I said you
were a fucking traitor

13
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:30,777
it was to protect your ass.

14
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:33,572
What did you want me to say?

15
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:35,731
That you're my little brother?

16
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:37,325
That I love you?

17
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,161
They would've killed
you like an asshole.

18
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,122
You don't love anyone.

19
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:45,959
If that's what you think…

20
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:48,712
why are you here?

21
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,267
I came here so we could
talk like civilized people.

22
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:05,770
Like grown-ups.

23
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:07,355
Talk.

24
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,529
Let the American woman go.

25
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:17,949
Her family told me
that she's innocent.

26
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,535
You have the power.

27
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:22,954
Release her, forget about her.

28
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:24,331
Those guys are rats.

29
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:27,626
They're fucking killers.

30
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:31,504
But what would you know?

31
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:36,051
For 10 years you've been
living the good life.

32
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:38,220
Traveling.

33
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:40,430
Chasing ass.

34
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:43,475
Playing your music.

35
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:51,691
They electrocuted my balls.

36
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:54,569
You think I did that to you?

37
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:59,741
Do you think I did that to you?

38
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,461
Can you or can't
you do something?

39
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:24,599
Nice road for a sports car.

40
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:29,020
Where are we?

41
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:40,282
No.

42
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,586
Now, which one is
you? Which one?

43
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:54,880
I told you who the fuck I am!

44
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:20,947
Snow ball!

45
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:37,505
Lay down! You stay
the fuck down!

46
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:39,132
Shut up!

47
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:40,967
Shut your mouth!

48
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:42,093
Stop!

49
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:45,263
Mom!

50
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:46,431
You're gonna fucking learn!

51
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,935
Fucking listen to me.

52
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,190
Do it.

53
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:28,992
Hey.

54
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:33,705
I'm bad.

55
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:36,374
I'm so bad.

56
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,252
You're not bad.

57
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:48,887
You're Bambi.

58
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:33,909
Yeah. Let him in.

59
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:11,738
- Hola.
- Hey, man.

60
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:13,490
You ready to make some money?

61
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,991
I don't know, man.

62
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:17,827
Are you sure it's okay?

63
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:19,537
It's all good.

64
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:21,915
Come meet some of my friends.

65
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,876
- Come on.
- Okay.

66
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:33,593
You're safe here, bro.

67
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:35,571
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm gonna look after you.

68
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:36,595
Don't you worry.

69
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:39,766
A mosquito.

70
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,227
Only the female bites.

71
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:47,440
You know, she is the leading
cause of death in human history?

72
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:49,568
More so than any other cause.

73
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:55,615
Malaria. Zika. West Nile.
Yellow Fever. Dengue.

74
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:56,741
Mind your head.

75
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:57,909
You admire it.

76
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:01,663
I do. Yeah.

77
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,580
Some people think she may
have killed the dinosaurs.

78
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:11,548
This is Javi. He knows the place better
than anyone. And he's one of us now.

79
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:13,592
You've seen this video?

80
00:11:13,675 --> 00:11:16,344
You gotta watch it,
man. You gotta see this.

81
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,306
Hey, Javi. Mucho gusto.

82
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:21,474
She's the undisputed
killer of man.

83
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:23,018
The destroyer of worlds.

84
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:28,565
She's fed on both saints, emperors.
Young, old. Black, white. Male, female.

85
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:30,817
She doesn't discriminate.
It's all for blood.

86
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:32,611
She's lost it.
She's not well, man.

87
00:11:32,694 --> 00:11:33,904
It's all for survival.

88
00:11:34,404 --> 00:11:36,299
Yeah. Well, it doesn't even
sound like her, brother.

89
00:11:36,323 --> 00:11:38,199
- She's traumatized.
- Listen...

90
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:40,619
This is the beginning of
serious mental illness, dude.

91
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:43,496
Yeah. We got a bigger problem.

92
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,583
Tell him what you
told me. It's okay.

93
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:50,420
There is a rumor in the prison…

94
00:11:52,923 --> 00:11:55,425
that Amber is going
to be executed.

95
00:11:57,177 --> 00:12:00,931
Tariq wants revenge for
what you did to his brother.

96
00:12:01,014 --> 00:12:03,266
I... They don't want you
coming to rescue her.

97
00:12:04,684 --> 00:12:05,894
When?

98
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:09,189
I don't know, man.
Maybe in a few days.

99
00:12:09,272 --> 00:12:11,483
Tomás doesn't want to
do it, but eventually,

100
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:13,818
it would happen, you know.

101
00:12:13,902 --> 00:12:15,028
Is it only Tariq?

102
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:17,948
Anybody else have the authority
to order her execution?

103
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:19,407
He's the boss, man.

104
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:26,665
I'll call Mitch.

105
00:12:26,748 --> 00:12:27,749
I'll handle it.

106
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,376
Gracias, Javi.

107
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:32,128
Gracias, amigo.

108
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:18,341
Okay, Amber.

109
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,261
Third time is the charm, hmm?

110
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:43,033
Is it because of Hildy?

111
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:45,493
Yeah.

112
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:48,079
Is that why you're
not cooperating?

113
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:50,707
Why then, Amber?

114
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,502
Because you drugged me with
the wrong compound, Tommy.

115
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,506
Some kind of hallucinogen.

116
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:03,678
I've just been having these really vivid
daydreams of you being blown to pieces.

117
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:09,434
See, this drug, whatever it is,
it doesn't make me afraid of you.

118
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:15,065
Okay.

119
00:14:36,086 --> 00:14:37,504
Today is Monday, Amber.

120
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:44,052
This here, this day is Saturday.

121
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:49,516
It's a national holiday and it's also the
day I was told I'm supposed to kill you.

122
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:54,271
I don't want to kill you,
but I will. Saturday.

123
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:57,232
This is the day that
you're going to die.

124
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,151
Please nod if you understand.

125
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:06,116
I'll take that as a "yes".

126
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:04,109
- Hi. Your name, please?
- I'm not on the list.

127
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:08,446
I'm here to see Eric Haas II. I'm
his in-law. This is an emergency.

128
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,489
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I can't help you.

129
00:17:10,574 --> 00:17:12,284
Maggie Chesborough. He'll know.

130
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:14,410
Ray?

131
00:17:14,494 --> 00:17:15,534
Ma'am, is there a problem?

132
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:18,331
You want me to make a scene?
Okay, I'll make a scene.

133
00:17:18,415 --> 00:17:21,167
Eric Haas, get down here.

134
00:17:22,544 --> 00:17:24,129
Ma'am, I work for Mr. Haas.

135
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:26,631
- He's not here right now. Can I help you?
- I doubt it.

136
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:28,341
- Mr. Haas?
- Ma'am?

137
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:31,571
Turn around and wait for me
at the bottom of the stairs

138
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:32,795
or I'm gonna call the Sheriff.

139
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:34,306
Please, ma'am.

140
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:38,685
Go on. It'll be okay.

141
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:07,380
Hi, boss. Yeah,
she's right here.

142
00:18:08,673 --> 00:18:10,550
Well, this is a
pleasant surprise.

143
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:12,844
Are you really not here?

144
00:18:12,928 --> 00:18:16,306
I flew back from Colombia and
drove all the way here to see you.

145
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:18,308
I'm here now, Maggie.

146
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:21,978
Okay. The boys are in
trouble down there.

147
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:26,733
They've turned into criminals,
kidnapping people in broad daylight.

148
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:28,568
No, that's insane.

149
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:34,783
Your man, Roy, is dead.

150
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,369
Maggie, have you been
taking your pills?

151
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:40,288
You don't believe
me? Call your son.

152
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:44,084
They're off the rails.
They are on the warpath.

153
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:46,628
There's nothing I can do if he
wants to throw away his life.

154
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:49,297
I told him to stay home and
let the professionals go,

155
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:51,675
and he said, "Fuck
off, old man."

156
00:18:55,011 --> 00:19:01,726
You know, our obligations to our children
do not end when they're unkind to us.

157
00:19:03,603 --> 00:19:06,231
They need a force multiplier.

158
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:08,567
A force multiplier.

159
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,903
I didn't know you were such an
expert on military strategy.

160
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:17,576
Every grandfather, every father, every
single blessed son in my family tree

161
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:21,788
has served in the United States military
since the days of Robert E. Lee.

162
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:24,749
And before that, my
blood fought the Apaches.

163
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,628
So, damn right, I know something
about military strategy.

164
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:30,672
Send help.

165
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:33,008
Protect your kin.

166
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:03,955
Any ideas?

167
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:12,047
Amber, it's Thursday.

168
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:14,382
In 48 hours…

169
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:18,803
I'm going to have to kill you.

170
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:24,768
We're wasting the last
of our precious time.

171
00:20:26,394 --> 00:20:30,065
And I have to go to Caracas,
and I have to give a report.

172
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:40,116
This is the time to move.

173
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,424
Amber?

174
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,685
El Dorado.

175
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:10,564
Qué?

176
00:21:11,815 --> 00:21:12,857
El Dorado.

177
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:16,695
Dorado?

178
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:21,741
Take her off the program.
We are wasting medicine.

179
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:24,160
Are we falling asleep or what?

180
00:21:26,997 --> 00:21:29,624
This party is getting
a little bit boring,

181
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,752
don't you think? Shall we
make it more interesting?

182
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:37,465
Shall I jump in this
fucking freezing water?

183
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:38,549
Jump!

184
00:21:38,592 --> 00:21:40,969
Fuck it. Let's jump! Here I go!

185
00:21:41,052 --> 00:21:42,262
Should I do it?

186
00:22:08,163 --> 00:22:09,748
What are you doing up here?

187
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:12,417
Are you suicidal?

188
00:22:13,043 --> 00:22:14,294
Save me.

189
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:16,755
Oh, fuck.

190
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:19,841
That wasn't funny. Sorry.

191
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:25,055
Cool watch. Did your
daddy buy that for you?

192
00:22:25,138 --> 00:22:28,016
You know, you're, like, the only
girl at this party who's not rich.

193
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:31,144
And I bet you got a
daddy with a shotgun too

194
00:22:31,228 --> 00:22:33,146
- somewhere in Tennessee.
- Georgia.

195
00:22:33,855 --> 00:22:37,567
No daddy. But I got a brother who
knows his way around a crossbow.

196
00:22:38,944 --> 00:22:40,028
Primitive. I like it.

197
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:43,698
Actually, you should meet him.

198
00:22:44,491 --> 00:22:46,243
Why? So he can kick my ass?

199
00:22:46,326 --> 00:22:48,370
No, 'cause I can tell
you've got a problem

200
00:22:48,453 --> 00:22:50,288
with finding meaning
in your life.

201
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:53,708
He deals with guys like you all
the time. You know, lost souls.

202
00:22:55,877 --> 00:22:57,295
Is he a therapist?

203
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:01,383
Special Forces.

204
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:10,183
Wow.

205
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:11,619
- You weren't kidding, huh?
- Come on.

206
00:23:11,643 --> 00:23:13,395
This is legit redneck.

207
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:15,522
- Hey.
- Hey.

208
00:23:17,857 --> 00:23:19,693
- Shut up.
- Hey, man.

209
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,487
- Sorry, man.
- Just give me your fucking hand.

210
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:24,531
Anyone who's good with my
sister, is good with me.

211
00:23:26,449 --> 00:23:28,118
Why don't you take a go?

212
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:32,205
Now, the biggest thing when you're holding
a knife and there's blood and slippery,

213
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:35,000
is you make sure you cut the
fucking deer and not your fingers.

214
00:23:37,002 --> 00:23:38,896
Cut down here. You'll feel
where the hardness is,

215
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,960
- you'll end up with a nice loin.
- You can feel it?

216
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:13,788
Hey!

217
00:24:24,424 --> 00:24:25,550
Bambi?

218
00:24:31,223 --> 00:24:32,224
Is that you?

219
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:34,726
Hey, Bug. It's me.

220
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:37,312
How'd you get in here?

221
00:24:37,395 --> 00:24:38,772
That's what I do, kiddo.

222
00:24:43,693 --> 00:24:45,362
Why do you look so down?

223
00:24:49,115 --> 00:24:50,992
A little deprivation
is no big deal.

224
00:24:54,287 --> 00:24:55,288
No food?

225
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,006
When we hit Tora Bora to hunt
bin Laden, we had to choose.

226
00:25:06,341 --> 00:25:08,218
Carry bullets or carry food.

227
00:25:11,221 --> 00:25:13,515
I lost 36 pounds in two weeks.

228
00:25:17,477 --> 00:25:18,520
It's just mental.

229
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:20,939
It's just mental.

230
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:27,237
This isn't real.
It's a hallucination.

231
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:34,744
Well, the good thing
is nobody can kill me.

232
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:44,379
Bambi?

233
00:25:57,517 --> 00:25:59,519
Welcome to my home
away from home.

234
00:26:00,562 --> 00:26:01,563
Yeah. What's up?

235
00:26:02,188 --> 00:26:04,274
Bambi wanted me to talk
to you about the exfil.

236
00:26:07,402 --> 00:26:08,778
Is this the condition?

237
00:26:08,862 --> 00:26:12,198
- Tell your guys it'll make them safer.
- Is that true?

238
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,345
It's true that, if you wear those patches
and present as Colombian military,

239
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:17,370
I can get you out.

240
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:22,834
Bambi agreed to this?

241
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,295
You're the last domino.

242
00:26:26,838 --> 00:26:28,006
Fuck me.

243
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:32,093
You're turning this into a
false flag operation, huh?

244
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:36,389
You're using us to create
instability on the border.

245
00:26:36,473 --> 00:26:38,058
I am not doing anything at all.

246
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:40,477
You asked for an
exfil, all right?

247
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,563
That takes dedicated
resources. Backside support.

248
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:46,983
I have to get up on Colombia's
comms. Reposition satellites.

249
00:26:47,776 --> 00:26:49,194
Peacetime, that's a no.

250
00:26:49,277 --> 00:26:50,487
Everyone's constipated.

251
00:26:51,196 --> 00:26:53,281
State of emergency,
things get looser.

252
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:54,616
Now, give me a little war…

253
00:26:56,618 --> 00:26:57,911
the juices start to flow.

254
00:27:09,548 --> 00:27:10,674
You're right.

255
00:27:11,883 --> 00:27:13,802
It's just straight.

256
00:27:56,845 --> 00:27:57,846
Gentlemen!

257
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:01,224
Everyone down quickly, I don't want
anyone sleeping. We don't have time.

258
00:28:07,522 --> 00:28:08,607
You Tiburon?

259
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:10,692
- Sí, señor.
- Mucho gusto.

260
00:28:11,443 --> 00:28:12,485
What have you been told?

261
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:13,862
Just you are the boss.

262
00:28:16,072 --> 00:28:17,073
Good.

263
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,761
We're good.

264
00:28:52,943 --> 00:28:54,611
Raise your hand if
you speak English.

265
00:28:58,114 --> 00:28:59,115
Okay, that's good.

266
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,661
So, first things first.

267
00:29:02,744 --> 00:29:07,832
Nobody, not even your family, should
know you're involved in this, okay?

268
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:10,001
You all need to think long
and hard about the money.

269
00:29:10,794 --> 00:29:15,340
When we get Amber, there's gonna be a
bonus on top of your initial salary.

270
00:29:16,383 --> 00:29:19,844
If that's your only motivation,
then y'all need to reconsider.

271
00:29:19,928 --> 00:29:23,723
Because we may ask you to do
something for which there is no price.

272
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:29,396
We value civilian lives.

273
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:33,692
But make no mistake, we're bringing
my wife home no matter what.

274
00:29:34,276 --> 00:29:36,444
He and I, we're here for family.

275
00:29:36,528 --> 00:29:38,321
We're here to save
an innocent woman.

276
00:29:38,947 --> 00:29:42,993
A daughter, a wife and a sister.

277
00:29:43,743 --> 00:29:47,289
You should be here
for honor, for glory.

278
00:29:47,956 --> 00:29:50,333
Doing something fucking
meaningful with your life.

279
00:29:51,418 --> 00:29:55,589
Now, that may sound cheesy to some
of you. We don't really give a shit.

280
00:29:56,298 --> 00:30:00,302
If it does, you can leave
right now. No hard feelings.

281
00:30:00,385 --> 00:30:03,013
They're fighting to
save their family.

282
00:30:03,388 --> 00:30:06,266
We need to be here for honor.

283
00:30:08,226 --> 00:30:10,562
If you're not, leave.

284
00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:13,231
- Understood?
- Understood.

285
00:30:14,024 --> 00:30:15,191
Good.

286
00:30:15,275 --> 00:30:18,361
We've labeled the
buildings 1 through 8.

287
00:30:18,445 --> 00:30:20,530
As you can see,
the place is huge.

288
00:30:20,614 --> 00:30:25,785
My team, Alpha, will come in on
the north side with building 0-7.

289
00:30:26,536 --> 00:30:29,039
We'll clear that.
Set an overwatch.

290
00:30:29,122 --> 00:30:31,958
I'm taking Bravo team across
to the west side of the lake.

291
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:36,838
Oso, you're leading Charlie team coming
in on the south side near guard tower 2.

292
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:40,258
You set your overwatch on
the roof of building 0-4.

293
00:30:40,342 --> 00:30:44,888
Tiburon, you'll take Delta team on
the east side and cover the main gate.

294
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:49,392
Once all teams are in their
set points, we'll start at 0-1,

295
00:30:49,476 --> 00:30:53,355
which Javi has confirmed
connects to the prison, 0-2.

296
00:30:53,438 --> 00:30:58,026
There's maybe 200 families
living and working there.

297
00:30:58,693 --> 00:31:02,197
The Narcos keep watch
over every single one.

298
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,200
It's a self sustainable city.
No one is allowed to leave.

299
00:31:05,283 --> 00:31:08,578
Wait a sec, you
said 200 families?

300
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,079
At least 200.

301
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:13,500
How do we find her with
so many people there?

302
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,668
Especially at night.

303
00:31:14,751 --> 00:31:17,170
We're gonna be using
these ultra quiet drones.

304
00:31:17,254 --> 00:31:20,298
Prototype, next-generation
technology.

305
00:31:20,382 --> 00:31:22,634
Now, the drones
cannot locate Amber,

306
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:25,303
but they can distinguish
friend from foe.

307
00:31:26,346 --> 00:31:29,140
They have the ability
to detect firearms.

308
00:31:29,724 --> 00:31:32,519
So if this person here
or here had a firearm,

309
00:31:32,602 --> 00:31:34,688
they'd be blinking
red, not blue.

310
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:39,776
There are two bad things that
can happen on this mission.

311
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:42,404
Number one, we get compromised.

312
00:31:43,113 --> 00:31:46,449
The other bad thing can
happen is we can't find her.

313
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:53,206
When we go in, we
will use stealth.

314
00:31:53,915 --> 00:31:54,958
We will use surprise.

315
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:58,211
And any chance of discovery needs
to be dealt with immediately.

316
00:31:58,295 --> 00:32:00,589
Because there is no way
we can safely search

317
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:04,843
thousands of square feet of interior
space within our mission parameters.

318
00:32:04,926 --> 00:32:09,848
We cannot get into a prolonged
gunfight with them, or we will lose.

319
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:11,433
The good news is,

320
00:32:11,516 --> 00:32:12,767
we know where she is.

321
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:17,647
She's gonna be where she always is,
in building 0-2, or the cocaine lab.

322
00:32:18,857 --> 00:32:22,485
And we have that on good authority
from our human intelligence.

323
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:24,129
He's gonna become
your new best friend.

324
00:32:28,575 --> 00:32:30,201
She's kept in the
prison every night.

325
00:32:33,496 --> 00:32:36,082
Bravo team is going to
search building 0-1.

326
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:39,544
We expect them to encounter an
accountant who may be working late.

327
00:32:39,628 --> 00:32:41,671
He will be subdued quietly,

328
00:32:41,755 --> 00:32:44,132
and then they will proceed
to search building 0-2,

329
00:32:44,216 --> 00:32:48,094
the first and the second floor,
where they will locate Amber.

330
00:32:48,178 --> 00:32:51,223
At which point the teams
will begin to withdraw.

331
00:32:51,306 --> 00:32:53,475
Bravo team will
retrace its steps.

332
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:56,394
Overwatch positions go back
to where they started from,

333
00:32:56,478 --> 00:32:59,105
and we pull out without
anybody being the wiser.

334
00:32:59,189 --> 00:33:02,525
Now, it is very important that we
preserve these overwatch positions.

335
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:05,654
Because if we lose
them, we cannot search.

336
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:09,241
Now, we're gonna put on these
uniforms and Colombian tags.

337
00:33:09,324 --> 00:33:13,286
From now on, this is a
Colombian military op.

338
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:18,625
'Cause we believe they will fold faster
if they think that we're Colombian army.

339
00:33:19,376 --> 00:33:20,686
Now, I want you to
say it in Spanish.

340
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,420
We are Colombian Military.

341
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:23,880
Exactly. Say it.

342
00:33:24,256 --> 00:33:25,882
We are Colombian Military.

343
00:33:27,884 --> 00:33:29,511
We gotta move fast though.

344
00:33:29,594 --> 00:33:31,763
We only have 48
minutes to do this job.

345
00:33:31,846 --> 00:33:36,309
At this point, they will get their chance
to call the VZ military for support.

346
00:33:37,852 --> 00:33:42,649
If anybody gets jammed up, the
mission continues. We wait for nobody.

347
00:33:42,732 --> 00:33:46,486
Check your gear. Study your
maps. Learn the layout cold.

348
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,071
We launch tonight.

349
00:33:53,702 --> 00:33:57,581
You know that we are
100% in the business.

350
00:33:57,664 --> 00:34:01,376
I think the important thing that we
bring to the table now, with us here,

351
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:04,838
is our connections with the most
important people in Venezuela.

352
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,305
That bullshit of
bourgeois connections,

353
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:16,266
hanging out with the
elite, the powerful,

354
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:17,767
that was in the past.

355
00:34:18,852 --> 00:34:20,811
Yes, that is true.

356
00:34:20,896 --> 00:34:23,189
We are the elite now.

357
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:26,568
Let's speak clearly here.

358
00:34:27,402 --> 00:34:30,030
Are you or are you not
with the government?

359
00:34:30,113 --> 00:34:32,033
Is there or isn't there
money for the government?

360
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:35,827
I'm gonna tell you
again, for the third time

361
00:34:35,911 --> 00:34:39,914
- we are 100% in it.
- Wow.

362
00:34:40,749 --> 00:34:42,291
Revolution, yes or no?

363
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:44,794
Yes, all the way!

364
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:47,797
Three hours going in
circles with this.

365
00:34:52,344 --> 00:34:53,260
The final strike.

366
00:34:53,345 --> 00:34:56,056
Please, speaking about
the final strike,

367
00:34:57,265 --> 00:35:00,227
I can't with the
topic of bullfights.

368
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:03,188
It's become a religion
for my husband.

369
00:35:03,271 --> 00:35:05,732
The bullfights are
better than religion.

370
00:35:05,815 --> 00:35:08,235
What do you think, Tariq?
Does it offend you?

371
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:11,363
Offend me?

372
00:35:11,446 --> 00:35:14,783
I don't know a thing
about bullfighting.

373
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:17,118
You have to come to
the bullfights with me.

374
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:22,457
Bullfighting to
me is too violent.

375
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,377
I may have thousands of defects

376
00:35:27,087 --> 00:35:28,547
but I'm not violent, no.

377
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,798
Never.

378
00:35:29,881 --> 00:35:31,883
You don't like violence?

379
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:33,426
Is that right, Momo?

380
00:35:34,094 --> 00:35:35,512
He doesn't like violence?

381
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:39,307
- I've never liked violence.
- No?

382
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:42,644
Does blood scare you, Tariq?

383
00:35:42,727 --> 00:35:44,479
You're being funny.

384
00:35:44,563 --> 00:35:48,525
Are you scared of the
bull's blood, the horns?

385
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,985
He's being funny.

386
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:52,487
This guy's an animal!

387
00:35:54,698 --> 00:35:56,116
You're being funny.

388
00:35:59,035 --> 00:36:00,078
Come on, what's wrong?

389
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:02,747
What's wrong with you?

390
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,917
Calm down. Look,
he's not violent.

391
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:09,504
Sit down.

392
00:36:13,466 --> 00:36:14,968
I apologize.

393
00:36:19,973 --> 00:36:22,392
People around here
forget who is the boss.

394
00:36:28,732 --> 00:36:29,941
Well, cheers!

395
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,278
Long live the revolution.

396
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:35,697
For good and new things to come.

397
00:36:36,114 --> 00:36:38,700
Nothing like doing
business with friends.

398
00:36:38,783 --> 00:36:41,953
Cheers to all the
good things ahead.

399
00:36:43,163 --> 00:36:45,999
I'm really happy to
have you back, brother.

400
00:36:46,499 --> 00:36:49,336
My apologies about
what happened up there.

401
00:36:49,878 --> 00:36:51,463
But that idiot got stupid.

402
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:53,048
That's normal.

403
00:36:53,131 --> 00:36:54,591
Brothers fight.

404
00:36:54,674 --> 00:36:57,969
We always fight for bullshit
reasons. Even us, too.

405
00:36:58,261 --> 00:37:01,264
- Yes, but you always start.
- All right then.

406
00:37:01,348 --> 00:37:03,850
That may be, but
who saves your ass?

407
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:05,101
Me.

408
00:37:31,878 --> 00:37:32,879
Tariq.

409
00:37:43,848 --> 00:37:46,184
- Yeah.
- It's done. You go tonight.

410
00:37:57,654 --> 00:37:59,030
Tariq is off the board.

411
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:00,657
Good.

412
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:12,043
We should be offering
these guys more money.

413
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:14,004
Nah, it was enough.

414
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:18,258
For what we're
asking them to do?

415
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:21,845
Unfortunately, life
is cheap down here.

416
00:38:22,721 --> 00:38:25,807
The money we gave them, we can have
them for a month of gunslinging.

417
00:38:26,516 --> 00:38:27,976
We're only asking for one night.

418
00:38:35,317 --> 00:38:38,153
Can I ask you a question
I never asked before?

419
00:38:39,321 --> 00:38:40,322
Sure.

420
00:38:42,782 --> 00:38:43,783
Why'd you join?

421
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:48,121
- What?
- I mean, you got all that money.

422
00:38:48,955 --> 00:38:50,206
Do what the fuck you want.

423
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:55,253
Why did you want to fuck
around with us in the military?

424
00:38:56,129 --> 00:38:57,797
You know the answer to that.

425
00:38:58,632 --> 00:39:00,967
No. Actually, I don't.

426
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:07,432
What?

427
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:13,939
It was because of you.

428
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,568
I looked up to you.

429
00:39:21,363 --> 00:39:22,364
Why?

430
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:27,410
Fuck, man. I need to
tell you something.

431
00:39:30,956 --> 00:39:34,209
I didn't really fuck up with
Drifter the way you think I did.

432
00:39:35,502 --> 00:39:37,837
So, you're saying Drifter
was in a survivable state?

433
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,801
Maybe.

434
00:39:44,135 --> 00:39:45,136
I don't think so.

435
00:39:48,723 --> 00:39:50,183
But ultimately it didn't matter,

436
00:39:50,267 --> 00:39:54,062
because I had to choose about getting
him or pulling you off the mountain.

437
00:39:58,316 --> 00:40:01,278
This has been eating
me alive, man.

438
00:40:02,237 --> 00:40:04,656
And filling me with a
coldness towards you.

439
00:40:09,411 --> 00:40:13,582
You know, I don't understand.
Why couldn't you get us both?

440
00:40:16,918 --> 00:40:18,670
Drifter was on the south side.

441
00:40:18,753 --> 00:40:22,632
If I ran to him, I wasn't able
to double back and get you

442
00:40:22,716 --> 00:40:24,885
because the Taliban were
maneuvering on our flank.

443
00:40:24,968 --> 00:40:26,968
- Yeah.
- And they would've pinned me with Drifter.

444
00:40:28,805 --> 00:40:30,223
And once I was in his position,

445
00:40:30,307 --> 00:40:32,642
the only way off that
mountain was the south side,

446
00:40:33,727 --> 00:40:36,563
which would have meant
leaving you behind.

447
00:40:36,646 --> 00:40:40,442
You could've come for me, and then
we could've gotten Drifter together.

448
00:40:40,942 --> 00:40:41,943
No.

449
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:46,781
There was no time.

450
00:40:51,286 --> 00:40:53,496
I've been doing this
for 20 years, you know.

451
00:40:54,915 --> 00:40:56,541
Deployed 14 times.

452
00:40:57,375 --> 00:41:00,295
Eight confirmed kills. I've been
given every award you can think of.

453
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:06,426
And I'm telling you, as God is my witness,
one of you guys would have died that day.

454
00:41:07,636 --> 00:41:09,137
No fucking doubt about it.

455
00:41:17,687 --> 00:41:19,814
Shit, man. I don't
know what to say. I...

456
00:41:25,695 --> 00:41:26,863
I love you, man.

457
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,451
I loved Drifter.

458
00:41:32,994 --> 00:41:34,913
I guess I wish you
would have saved him.

459
00:41:36,498 --> 00:41:37,916
He had two kids, you know.

460
00:41:42,128 --> 00:41:46,883
He comes home. Yes or no?

461
00:41:48,677 --> 00:41:49,678
Yeah.

462
00:41:51,596 --> 00:41:53,890
Sometimes I wish I would
have saved Drifter too.

463
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,335
- Good luck. See you there.
- Gracias.
