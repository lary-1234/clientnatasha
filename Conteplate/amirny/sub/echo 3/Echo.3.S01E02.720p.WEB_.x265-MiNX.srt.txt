1
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:57,350
Where's my hairbrush?

2
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:59,811
In the bathroom,
princess, where else?

3
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:01,271
I looked, it's not there.

4
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:03,189
Why don't you check again?

5
00:01:03,273 --> 00:01:04,356
What's up bug?

6
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,734
Where's my hairbrush?

7
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:06,651
I don't know.

8
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:09,046
- Do you want me to help you?
- I think the brush is hiding.

9
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,550
- Come, let's go.
- Where could it be?

10
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:12,448
Listen, I need a favor.

11
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,366
Yes?

12
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,786
Did you hear anything about the
American woman that went missing?

13
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,455
No. Here in Colombia?

14
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:20,797
I'll tell you, wait.
Come here love, let's go.

15
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:25,253
I already looked everywhere!

16
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:26,588
Everywhere?

17
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:27,714
Everywhere, Daddy.

18
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:30,342
How about here? You look
here, and I'll look there.

19
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:31,593
It's not there either.

20
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:32,761
I looked already.

21
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:34,262
Not there either?

22
00:01:34,346 --> 00:01:36,890
If I were a brush,
where would I hide?

23
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:38,849
Let's see.

24
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:41,353
How about here?
Look in that box.

25
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:42,436
The hairbrush.

26
00:01:44,773 --> 00:01:47,317
- Come here.
- Okay, let's see!

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,944
You do it.

28
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:50,237
Come here.

29
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,321
My little queen.

30
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:53,657
What's that sound?

31
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,367
A little bird?

32
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,326
The brush?

33
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:57,244
There it is.

34
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:58,370
The water?

35
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,420
- What are you doing?
- I'm putting it away.

36
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,590
Come here. I'll tell
you about the American.

37
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:15,220
Her name is Amber Chesborough.

38
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:18,306
She was near San José del
Guaviare when she disappeared.

39
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:20,600
Was it the rebels?

40
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:21,560
Yes.

41
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:22,852
What was she doing there?

42
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,438
Traditional medicine.

43
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:26,606
Researching.

44
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:29,192
Her father-in-law
just called me.

45
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:32,487
He's a very big deal in the U.S.

46
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:34,251
Of course I told him
I was at his disposal.

47
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,035
So, what do you think?

48
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:43,707
Amber's brother and husband
are flying here right now.

49
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,376
Maybe through one
of your sources

50
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:49,629
we'd be able to get
inside information.

51
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,549
They're a good family.

52
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:53,632
Good people.

53
00:04:15,382 --> 00:04:17,384
I'm calling to ask if
you have any information

54
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,843
regarding a kidnapped American?

55
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,805
Amber Chesborough.

56
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,364
Señora.

57
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:40,948
Bueno.

58
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:17,652
Good morning.

59
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:37,464
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

60
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:39,424
Honorable congressmen.

61
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:43,845
My party has considered it
pertinent to put at your disposal

62
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:46,890
for the consideration
of this plenary

63
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:49,059
a 90% investment

64
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:50,894
for the good of the people.

65
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:07,035
- Excuse me, Senator.
- Yes?

66
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:08,954
- May I ask you something?
- Of course.

67
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:11,248
It's about the kidnapping
of the American woman.

68
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:14,251
I'd like to know if you think
it could be related to the FARC.

69
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:15,627
Of course not.

70
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,710
Not at all.

71
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:19,214
Is this an official statement?

72
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:22,634
If there has been a crime, the
criminals will obviously have to pay.

73
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:23,837
But I know nothing about it.

74
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:24,885
Okay, then…

75
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:27,430
Who do you think
may be involved?

76
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:29,599
You said one question
and it's been three.

77
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,536
- Senator…
- No, I can't talk about it.

78
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,228
Off the record,
you know very well

79
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:35,647
this could be a tragedy
for the peace agreement.

80
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:37,899
You're not worried?

81
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:41,486
Off the record, they're
a gang of criminals

82
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,071
and pseudo-intellectuals.

83
00:06:43,655 --> 00:06:45,375
I know people who have
been talking to them.

84
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:47,325
They're giving her back.

85
00:06:47,993 --> 00:06:49,327
Are you sure about that?

86
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:53,665
Yes.

87
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:55,125
Now, if I may…

88
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,459
- Ms. Matíz.
- Yes, of course.

89
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:57,919
Good luck in the polls.

90
00:06:58,003 --> 00:06:59,003
Thank you.

91
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:47,510
Where are we?

92
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:50,513
Welcome lady.

93
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,643
- Go, up!
- Where are we?

94
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:58,939
Relax. You're home, don't worry.

95
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:15,664
Okay.

96
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:18,500
We have men on the street
watching you, stay here.

97
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,679
Excuse me, do you know
where I can find Enrique?

98
00:09:10,385 --> 00:09:12,012
No, ask there.

99
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:13,095
Thank you.

100
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:19,311
Hi.

101
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:21,021
- Are you Enrique?
- No.

102
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:22,397
Do you know where he is?

103
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:30,780
Enrique?

104
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:33,700
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

105
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:36,703
It's a pleasure to meet you.

106
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:39,456
I'm a big fan.

107
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:40,415
Thank you.

108
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:41,498
Have a seat.

109
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:52,802
So where do we begin?

110
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:56,723
Are you the spokesperson?

111
00:09:58,433 --> 00:09:59,433
Yes.

112
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:01,561
Yes, you could call me that.

113
00:10:02,062 --> 00:10:03,897
We usually don't
speak to the press.

114
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:06,650
But, now's the time.

115
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:10,237
What group do you belong to?

116
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:13,698
I mean, you're part
of the ELN, right?

117
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:14,658
No.

118
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:16,952
We're not part of any group.

119
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:19,788
We're something new.

120
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:20,997
We don't have a name.

121
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:22,791
We don't have a brand.

122
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,294
Perhaps you can be
the one to name us.

123
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:30,674
No, I don't think so.

124
00:10:30,757 --> 00:10:31,591
No?

125
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:34,261
No, I'm not here to
write a story about you.

126
00:10:36,805 --> 00:10:38,557
But, it would be great.

127
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,433
You're the best
journalist in the country.

128
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:42,519
Yes, but I won't
give you publicity.

129
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,442
I'm a bit confused.

130
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,754
I thought this was supposed
to be an interview?

131
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:53,530
No, this is not an interview.

132
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:57,701
I'm here to ask you to
free the American woman.

133
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:01,454
Once you do it, we can discuss
the possibility of an interview.

134
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:05,834
I don't understand.

135
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:10,297
You're telling me what to do?

136
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:12,339
No.

137
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:16,261
I'm here to give you some
advice, for your own safety.

138
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:22,684
What the fuck?

139
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:23,602
You're a journalist.

140
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:26,813
You can't come in here, threaten
me, tell me what to do and…

141
00:11:26,897 --> 00:11:28,064
Let's see…

142
00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:30,775
imagine that at this very moment

143
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:33,945
the military is deciding what
actions to take to solve this matter.

144
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:38,450
And I'm the person holding
her hands out like this…

145
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:41,620
In search of peace.

146
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:44,623
But, what would happen
if I change my mind?

147
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:48,752
And simply suggest for
them to be tougher on you.

148
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:50,921
They could come here tonight.

149
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:53,089
While you're sleeping.

150
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:07,062
Why don't you go
and fuck yourself?

151
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:13,318
I'm very sorry.

152
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,196
Excuse me.

153
00:12:57,487 --> 00:12:58,947
Fuck.

154
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:19,009
I'm warm. I'm dry.
Nobody's shooting at me.

155
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:29,102
I'm warm. I'm dry.
Nobody's shooting at me.

156
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:46,369
Please, God. Dear
Heavenly Father, please...

157
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,581
Okay.

158
00:13:54,377 --> 00:13:55,754
Bambi. Where are you, Bambi?

159
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:57,631
Fucking listen to me.

160
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:15,815
Welcome to Bogotá.

161
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:40,257
Hi. US special operations.

162
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:42,634
Morning.

163
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:02,362
It might take two days.
It might take a week.

164
00:15:03,154 --> 00:15:04,906
You get the fuck outta here.

165
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:09,661
I'm gonna get the
fuck out of here.

166
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,561
Come on.

167
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:37,397
All right. Fuck this.

168
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:42,777
Scuse me.

169
00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:48,658
Hey.

170
00:15:50,118 --> 00:15:52,329
- Sorry for the wait, guys.
- Yeah.

171
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:55,081
Amick Dunn. Embassy security.

172
00:15:55,165 --> 00:15:56,166
Hello.

173
00:15:56,708 --> 00:16:00,629
So, there is some
positive news here.

174
00:16:00,712 --> 00:16:01,546
Okay.

175
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,882
Kidnappers have
asked for $250,000.

176
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:04,965
So pay it.

177
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:08,470
It's not that simple.
We countered at 100.

178
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:11,139
Or I'll pay it. We'll
back-channel it later.

179
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:14,809
We'll meet in the middle.
And we'll wait a few days.

180
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:17,020
See, if you offer
them that amount, you…

181
00:16:17,103 --> 00:16:19,123
- You're gonna wait a few days?
- …they'll move the goalposts.

182
00:16:19,147 --> 00:16:22,525
I sort of studied the history
of kidnapping in Colombia.

183
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:23,818
Well, that's just great.

184
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:25,320
I get where you're coming from.

185
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:27,239
You don't, actually.

186
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:30,617
Why don't you just go get your
chief of station, all right?

187
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:33,995
Okay. Okay.

188
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,121
All right.

189
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:59,604
Hello. I'm Natalie Foster, COS.

190
00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:00,897
Alex Chesborough.

191
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:02,857
Eric Haas.

192
00:17:02,941 --> 00:17:03,817
You want answers.

193
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,444
Yes, ma'am. We just
want to be read in.

194
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:09,839
Okay. Well, why don't you grab
your things and follow me?

195
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,449
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Great.

196
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:14,995
You've already been filled
in on the negotiations?

197
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:16,079
Yes, we have.

198
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:21,584
But, you know, he means "read
in" as if you trust us. Okay?

199
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:24,838
As if we're on the same team. As
if we have security clearance.

200
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,423
As if we do this for a living.

201
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:29,676
Are you really treating this
as a fucking business deal?

202
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,320
You know she's linked
to the agency, right?

203
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:32,679
They're not aware of that.

204
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:35,724
In Colombia, kidnappings usually
are business transactions.

205
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:39,311
And I don't work for you,
so please watch your tone

206
00:17:39,394 --> 00:17:41,771
- when you're in my embassy.
- Ma'am...

207
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:46,026
Honestly, we're
desperate for something.

208
00:17:47,402 --> 00:17:51,573
She's his wife. She's
my sister. Please.

209
00:17:56,328 --> 00:17:59,789
You two look dehydrated from that
flight, and we're at 8,000 feet.

210
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,953
Come on. Let's go get you
some water. It's downstairs.

211
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:20,644
I'm going to trust you guys.

212
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:33,823
Help yourselves.

213
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:36,326
Thanks.

214
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:42,040
Are we still in the same house?

215
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:43,500
Yes, ma'am.

216
00:18:44,334 --> 00:18:48,255
How about we go again with any
new specificity and context?

217
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:51,007
Sorry. So, according to
their cell phone data,

218
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:54,886
she is still in that red
house here. In Ciudad Bolívar.

219
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:02,102
I can hear two male adults inside,
undetermined amount of kids

220
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:05,146
and just a lot of people
coming in and out.

221
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:11,861
So as you can see, we
have it all in hand.

222
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:14,030
Is that Colombian SF?

223
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,176
The colonel in charge, yes.
But we're not gonna need him.

224
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,203
Negotiations are gonna work. We'll
have her back in a couple of days.

225
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:21,746
Do you mind if I speak to him?

226
00:19:23,373 --> 00:19:24,541
Sure, you can try.

227
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,128
Colonel Pereira.

228
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:30,732
These are the husband
and the brother.

229
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:32,632
Good morning Colonel.

230
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:35,468
I'm part of a JSOC
military unit.

231
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:37,762
Delta?

232
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:38,847
Delta.

233
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:40,557
If you have a moment

234
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:43,143
we'd like to have a
quick talk with you.

235
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:47,105
Your perspective is
very important to me.

236
00:19:48,773 --> 00:19:50,358
Permission to disclose?

237
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:51,442
Yes.

238
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:54,112
I have a call. I'm
gonna let you boys chat.

239
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:55,196
Thank you.

240
00:19:56,656 --> 00:19:58,366
English or Spanish?

241
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,452
English please, for my friend.

242
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:01,620
- Sure.
- Thank you.

243
00:20:04,915 --> 00:20:09,586
This neighborhood makes it very,
very hard to neutralize the tangos.

244
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,380
There are too many spotters.

245
00:20:12,464 --> 00:20:16,593
Local kids, gangs,
shooters on motorcycles.

246
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:20,931
If one policeman goes in,
all the alarms go off.

247
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,851
I have also
established three OPs.

248
00:20:25,435 --> 00:20:28,647
Here, here and here. Making
a triangle with the snipers.

249
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,857
It's hard for me to
get the green flag.

250
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:36,029
Authorization must come from the embassy.
I'm stuck under a lot of approvals.

251
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:37,864
And what about the exfil?

252
00:20:38,657 --> 00:20:42,911
Well, I'm sure you know it's
always the most dangerous part.

253
00:20:42,994 --> 00:20:45,247
The moment we grab that package

254
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,375
the neighborhood will start
yelping like a wounded animal.

255
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,043
We'll be using 9mm ammunition

256
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:52,087
to minimize civilian casualties.

257
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:54,965
If we go, my commanders
will get her.

258
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:56,550
They're very experienced.

259
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:00,011
And now, what you can
tell me about her?

260
00:21:00,095 --> 00:21:03,390
I don't know her training.
Can she handle a weapon?

261
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:07,227
Will she be too scared
to move? Do we carry her?

262
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,815
She'll be the best
fighter you ever had.

263
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,370
How are you?

264
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:28,623
I'm great.

265
00:21:32,752 --> 00:21:34,129
Are you sure you're okay?

266
00:21:34,713 --> 00:21:36,423
Yes, I want a phone.

267
00:21:38,258 --> 00:21:39,593
A cell phone.

268
00:21:40,552 --> 00:21:41,553
No.

269
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:44,014
For my family.

270
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:46,808
I can't do that.

271
00:21:46,892 --> 00:21:47,934
Please!

272
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:51,062
Money

273
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,023
for just a moment

274
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:54,274
to use your phone.

275
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:57,651
No.

276
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:00,822
Okay.

277
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,950
What is this?

278
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:17,214
It's my avalanche beacon.

279
00:22:18,006 --> 00:22:20,884
I don't know how to
say it in Spanish.

280
00:22:22,427 --> 00:22:23,470
How do you say it?

281
00:22:23,553 --> 00:22:24,554
Snow?

282
00:22:25,388 --> 00:22:26,556
Snow!

283
00:22:27,057 --> 00:22:28,099
For skiing.

284
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:32,312
Ski. I'm a skier. So…

285
00:22:33,063 --> 00:22:34,773
You're skiing Colombia?

286
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:37,192
No.

287
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:40,904
Not in Colombia.

288
00:22:48,745 --> 00:22:49,621
Thank you.

289
00:22:49,704 --> 00:22:50,956
You're welcome.

290
00:22:55,627 --> 00:22:57,295
I ski in Colorado!

291
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:29,786
Resistance!

292
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:31,997
Hey, I need to talk to Graciela.

293
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,331
Why?

294
00:23:33,415 --> 00:23:34,708
I can't tell you.

295
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:42,048
Resistance!

296
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:47,554
Long live the national strike!

297
00:23:49,973 --> 00:23:51,892
Long live the national strike!

298
00:23:59,357 --> 00:24:00,357
All good?

299
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
It's the American woman.

300
00:24:02,152 --> 00:24:03,152
She's fine.

301
00:24:03,653 --> 00:24:07,157
The thing is, the guys in the jungle
found something in her backpack.

302
00:24:07,824 --> 00:24:09,200
An electronic device.

303
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,830
Shit.

304
00:24:13,914 --> 00:24:14,998
It looks military.

305
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:16,374
That's what I thought.

306
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:18,459
Now what?

307
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,171
Will you talk to her?

308
00:24:25,342 --> 00:24:27,093
It's risky for me
to talk to her.

309
00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:29,888
So I need to be in charge.

310
00:24:31,723 --> 00:24:32,933
Give it here.

311
00:24:38,104 --> 00:24:40,065
I asked my wife,
Violeta, to get involved.

312
00:24:40,148 --> 00:24:42,692
She's a journalist
and very influential.

313
00:24:42,776 --> 00:24:45,070
I spoke with someone
this morning.

314
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:49,074
He is a kind of s... Publicist
for this organization.

315
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:50,700
He seems very unexperienced.

316
00:24:50,784 --> 00:24:53,787
I'm very scared about all
the situation that they make.

317
00:24:53,870 --> 00:25:00,043
At the same time, I met with the senator.
He was FARC, so he knows a lot, of course.

318
00:25:00,126 --> 00:25:03,630
And he believes that she
will be returned safely.

319
00:25:03,713 --> 00:25:05,715
What the CIA say?

320
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:09,135
Well, it's a
business transaction.

321
00:25:10,053 --> 00:25:13,807
It seems everybody is in
the same reality, right?

322
00:25:16,434 --> 00:25:19,396
Darling, you didn't mention
that this was a new group.

323
00:25:20,897 --> 00:25:22,357
Yeah, that's true.

324
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,236
- It's a new version of…M-19.
- M-19.

325
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:28,697
But it's all the same shit.

326
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,116
They all start political,
end up criminal.

327
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:35,036
But this moment where this group
is at is the most dangerous.

328
00:25:35,537 --> 00:25:36,830
Really? Why?

329
00:25:36,913 --> 00:25:39,124
Well, because they're young,
they can be unrealistic.

330
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:41,376
It's like playing
poker with a rookie

331
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,254
that still doesn't understand
the rules of the game.

332
00:25:45,422 --> 00:25:46,965
They make crazy bets.

333
00:25:56,057 --> 00:25:59,060
Long time ago, Violeta and her
sister were kidnapped by guerrillas.

334
00:25:59,644 --> 00:26:01,044
It was a lot more
common back then.

335
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:04,524
They called it "pesca
milagrosa," "miracle fishing."

336
00:26:05,025 --> 00:26:08,570
We had a lot of conversation with the
police and there was a lot of planning.

337
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:12,866
Things kept changing, and,
eventually, we did it ourselves.

338
00:26:13,575 --> 00:26:18,330
Yeah. She was killed
there in the cross fire.

339
00:26:19,915 --> 00:26:20,916
Very sorry.

340
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:26,522
I have a meeting now, and
I know you have one too.

341
00:26:26,546 --> 00:26:28,266
- But let's keep talking about this.
- Yeah.

342
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,092
How about you guys come for
dinner tonight, all right?

343
00:26:31,176 --> 00:26:32,677
You should be with
friends right now.

344
00:26:53,615 --> 00:26:55,242
Here comes your new girl boss!

345
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,411
Oops.

346
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:04,000
Welcome to your ranch.

347
00:27:09,256 --> 00:27:10,966
Looks like the party was fun.

348
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:15,554
Hey, Chino.

349
00:27:17,222 --> 00:27:18,223
Chino.

350
00:27:19,015 --> 00:27:20,016
Go get the American.

351
00:27:24,187 --> 00:27:25,772
Dude. A chair, please.

352
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,010
Gracias.

353
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,613
Hola.

354
00:28:56,696 --> 00:28:58,323
You are so pretty.

355
00:28:58,907 --> 00:29:00,825
Thank you. Hi.

356
00:29:02,744 --> 00:29:04,579
We're taking over, okay?

357
00:29:05,872 --> 00:29:06,873
Cool.

358
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:09,542
Who are you guys?

359
00:29:13,964 --> 00:29:15,006
2.0.

360
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,132
What's that?

361
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:18,510
Political stuff.
Don't worry about it.

362
00:29:18,593 --> 00:29:22,305
Okay. Cool. Yeah. No,
I totally get that.

363
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:24,933
Taking up arms against
an oppressive system.

364
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:28,645
I would totally do the same
thing if I was in your shoes.

365
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:30,522
Nah, I don't think so.

366
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:33,483
Yeah. I would, actually.

367
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:35,068
You'd go to a protest.

368
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:38,029
Right, that's what
we do in America.

369
00:29:38,113 --> 00:29:40,490
- This is also America, you know?
- South, but...

370
00:29:40,574 --> 00:29:44,661
No, I'm just saying that if
my country was in a civil war,

371
00:29:44,744 --> 00:29:46,913
I think I would join
too. That's all.

372
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:51,209
So you're saying that you came
down here for the trees, right?

373
00:29:51,293 --> 00:29:54,504
Yeah, I'm a research scientist.

374
00:29:54,588 --> 00:29:57,257
I specialize in
bioactive plants.

375
00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:01,094
And there are specific compounds
that are unique to this region

376
00:30:01,177 --> 00:30:05,181
that I find promising for
my addiction research.

377
00:30:05,265 --> 00:30:06,433
- Nice.
- Yeah.

378
00:30:06,516 --> 00:30:07,517
Cool.

379
00:30:08,685 --> 00:30:09,686
Yeah.

380
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:22,115
I know you probably need money,
so I could get you $2,000.

381
00:30:23,617 --> 00:30:26,703
You know, that's a lot of money
for a poor Colombian, right?

382
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,664
It's what I have.

383
00:30:29,748 --> 00:30:34,461
But wait, what will we do
with $2,000? Thank you.

384
00:30:36,254 --> 00:30:38,340
What will we do with $2,000?

385
00:30:39,257 --> 00:30:40,800
I don't know. What will we do?

386
00:30:43,386 --> 00:30:45,347
I don't know.

387
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:48,642
A lot of rice for your village.

388
00:30:54,064 --> 00:30:55,398
Chinese rice.

389
00:30:55,982 --> 00:30:58,360
This is really fucked up, guys.

390
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:02,405
Just, if you give me a
cell, I'll get you money.

391
00:31:02,489 --> 00:31:03,657
I'll get you a lot of money.

392
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,867
Okay, I'm gonna tell you
two things right now.

393
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,827
And I want you to
remember, okay?

394
00:31:07,911 --> 00:31:08,912
Okay.

395
00:31:08,995 --> 00:31:10,538
This is not a village.

396
00:31:10,622 --> 00:31:12,499
This is a fucking country
and a beautiful one.

397
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:18,421
And I don't want your money. And
we don't need your money, right?

398
00:31:20,215 --> 00:31:22,592
- Got it?
- Got it.

399
00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:28,932
We know who your husband is. We
are negotiating for your release.

400
00:31:29,516 --> 00:31:32,394
- Okay.
- But it's kind of a problem.

401
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:36,273
- Why?
- 'Cause we have doubts about you.

402
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:39,109
Maybe you're DEA or CIA?

403
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:44,364
Why would I be DEA or CIA?
This isn't Jason Bourne.

404
00:31:44,948 --> 00:31:46,408
Such a great film, you know?

405
00:31:46,491 --> 00:31:48,785
But no, isn't, actually.

406
00:31:50,912 --> 00:31:54,708
The technology in
your bag. Tell us.

407
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:57,127
Yeah, okay.

408
00:31:58,211 --> 00:32:01,047
My husband put it in there
for when I go skiing,

409
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:03,383
in case there's an avalanche.

410
00:32:03,884 --> 00:32:05,218
It was hiding in there.

411
00:32:06,803 --> 00:32:09,139
Got it. Okay, now
I understand you.

412
00:32:09,723 --> 00:32:12,851
So my husband can
be a bit of a dick,

413
00:32:12,934 --> 00:32:14,561
and he put it in there.

414
00:32:14,644 --> 00:32:17,939
I research it online, mi amor.

415
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:21,067
It's military.

416
00:32:21,568 --> 00:32:24,487
Yes. Good. Yes.

417
00:32:24,988 --> 00:32:29,117
His father sells military
weapons to our government.

418
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:31,161
- Okay?
- Yeah.

419
00:32:31,244 --> 00:32:34,247
And honestly, I didn't
know it was in there.

420
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:37,834
He put it in my bag.
I didn't even want it.

421
00:32:37,918 --> 00:32:40,045
- Why?
- Because I don't like to be followed.

422
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:42,589
So I said, "No, no. I
don't wanna take that."

423
00:32:42,672 --> 00:32:45,842
- You did, though.
- No. Goddamn it! No!

424
00:32:45,926 --> 00:32:49,554
I'm telling you that he put it in
my bag. Do you understand that?

425
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:51,056
He put it in my bag.

426
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:53,558
Who the fuck are you really?

427
00:32:54,684 --> 00:32:58,438
Are you CIA targeter?
Are you building a deck?

428
00:32:58,521 --> 00:32:59,981
- Are we your target?
- Am I?

429
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:03,860
I just met you guys. I don't
know who the fuck you are.

430
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:07,364
- Am... And I'm a what? What did you say?
- Targeter.

431
00:33:07,447 --> 00:33:10,033
You don't know
that word. Really?

432
00:33:11,368 --> 00:33:12,368
Come on.

433
00:33:20,293 --> 00:33:21,294
Hello.

434
00:33:21,378 --> 00:33:23,255
So we're being
overtaken by events.

435
00:33:23,338 --> 00:33:25,048
- I need you to brace yourself.
- Okay.

436
00:33:25,131 --> 00:33:27,968
These are bad people, okay,
but they're not totally stupid.

437
00:33:28,051 --> 00:33:29,719
They found Amber's
military beacon,

438
00:33:29,803 --> 00:33:32,305
and they've changed their
assessment of who she is.

439
00:33:33,056 --> 00:33:34,182
Now that she's valuable,

440
00:33:35,141 --> 00:33:37,018
negotiations are off.

441
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:40,730
They could hold her for 20 years
or they could kill her tomorrow.

442
00:33:41,731 --> 00:33:44,693
We're spinning up the rescue
mission. It's on the director's desk.

443
00:33:44,776 --> 00:33:46,069
Understood. Thank you.

444
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:53,243
That was Foster.

445
00:33:53,326 --> 00:33:55,787
Everything's changed in
the kidnappers' mindset.

446
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,706
That beacon you put in her bag,

447
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:03,169
they found it, and they've
determined that it's military.

448
00:34:05,755 --> 00:34:07,883
And now they assume
that she's high value.

449
00:34:10,385 --> 00:34:11,469
Negotiations are off.

450
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:14,597
Fuck.

451
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:18,727
Direct actions, two weeks
of planning minimum.

452
00:34:19,227 --> 00:34:20,729
Especially in that neighborhood.

453
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:24,065
I fucked her.

454
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:26,568
Pretty much.

455
00:34:27,235 --> 00:34:31,780
I'm so sorry, man. I
feel like a monster.

456
00:34:31,865 --> 00:34:34,617
Yeah, I don't give a
shit how you feel, man.

457
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:43,335
I was so fucking arrogant.

458
00:34:48,882 --> 00:34:50,925
I thought that beacon
would keep her safe.

459
00:35:00,727 --> 00:35:02,020
I can't let her die.

460
00:35:04,105 --> 00:35:05,523
I'm not gonna let her die.

461
00:35:08,735 --> 00:35:10,070
I can't let her die.

462
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:30,048
Let's talk about strategy, okay?

463
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:33,218
Roger.

464
00:35:35,303 --> 00:35:38,306
They're not gonna let her
go. The agency will cut ties.

465
00:35:39,182 --> 00:35:40,767
- I don't know.
- Well...

466
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:43,061
Foster seems sincere
about the strike plan.

467
00:35:43,144 --> 00:35:44,604
You want me to red-team that?

468
00:35:44,688 --> 00:35:46,356
Yeah, be my guest.

469
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,733
Hey, truly no
offense, but you...

470
00:35:48,817 --> 00:35:52,279
Part of you is still a kid from the sticks
happy to be in the room with a three-star.

471
00:35:52,362 --> 00:35:56,992
When I was a kid, we had CIA directors at
our dinner table begging us for crumbs.

472
00:35:58,034 --> 00:35:58,952
And?

473
00:35:59,035 --> 00:36:01,079
I know how these
decisions are made.

474
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:04,416
They're not gonna say, but
they won't approve a raid.

475
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:10,297
We need to get in there,
hit that house now.

476
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:29,519
I guess we should cancel dinner.

477
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:40,405
Here we go.

478
00:38:41,573 --> 00:38:42,574
That's it.

479
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:46,995
That's it. She could be
just down there, man.

480
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:52,626
- Right under that fucking cover.
- Uh-huh.

481
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:11,269
I'll take that.

482
00:39:12,812 --> 00:39:14,397
Right. Here you go.

483
00:39:35,252 --> 00:39:36,670
Wolf 6, this is Ray 2.

484
00:39:37,671 --> 00:39:39,548
I have the target on sight.

485
00:39:40,298 --> 00:39:42,259
They're the gringos
who were at the office.

486
00:39:42,342 --> 00:39:45,929
They're tall, wearing reflective
jackets and baseball caps.

487
00:39:46,429 --> 00:39:47,847
Nobody shoots.

488
00:39:47,931 --> 00:39:49,641
Understood? Freeze.

489
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:51,977
They're Purples, not Tangos.

490
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,144
Nobody shoots, I repeat.

491
00:39:54,604 --> 00:39:55,884
Anybody got eyes on the package?

492
00:39:56,273 --> 00:39:57,607
That's a negative, sir.

493
00:40:58,376 --> 00:41:01,129
I gotta show you something. There's
a tunnel on the first floor.

494
00:41:01,213 --> 00:41:02,253
It goes to the next house.

495
00:41:02,297 --> 00:41:04,424
Dude, she's been
sleeping up here.

496
00:41:10,013 --> 00:41:11,389
No.

497
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:14,726
Go back down the stairs.

498
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:16,728
Out, out!

499
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:25,737
They got in!

500
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,587
Two Purples are
trapped on the roof.

501
00:41:44,548 --> 00:41:46,466
Get the drone in the air.

502
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:52,973
Drone image on this screen, sir.

503
00:42:06,945 --> 00:42:09,197
Which direction are
the Purples moving?

504
00:42:09,281 --> 00:42:11,157
Sierra Whiskey sir,
Sierra Whiskey.

505
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,013
Hot terrace. They're
making contact, sir.

506
00:42:33,889 --> 00:42:36,016
You're cleared to fire
against all threats!

507
00:42:36,808 --> 00:42:37,934
Protect the Purples!

508
00:42:42,606 --> 00:42:44,566
I'm losing sight of them, sir.

509
00:42:45,233 --> 00:42:46,109
Wolf 6 to snipers.

510
00:42:46,192 --> 00:42:47,235
Does anyone see them?

511
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:48,612
That's a negative, sir.

512
00:42:49,863 --> 00:42:51,406
Does anyone have eyes on them?

513
00:42:53,825 --> 00:42:54,825
Negative.

514
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:26,918
Buenas noches.

515
00:44:42,017 --> 00:44:43,017
Wolf 6.

516
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:44,227
I have them on sight.

517
00:44:56,656 --> 00:44:58,408
All units from Sierra Whiskey,

518
00:44:58,491 --> 00:45:00,285
moving towards Sierra
Whiskey on a chase.

519
00:45:03,413 --> 00:45:05,165
Sir, we have a
motorcycle approaching.

520
00:45:05,248 --> 00:45:06,791
Authorized to fire on Tangos.

521
00:45:07,542 --> 00:45:08,752
Fire at will, sir.

522
00:45:42,327 --> 00:45:43,495
Wait, wait, wait.

523
00:45:47,874 --> 00:45:49,167
Come on.

524
00:45:51,753 --> 00:45:53,046
Just go, man.

525
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:03,890
High value target has
been shot by the Purples.

526
00:46:03,974 --> 00:46:05,684
Repeat, high value target.

527
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:07,561
Tango 2 has been
shot by the Purples.

528
00:46:07,644 --> 00:46:09,964
They're running away through
the streets and terraces, sir.

529
00:47:19,591 --> 00:47:21,259
We got our next move.
