1
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,171
No, no, no. Por favor, no...

2
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:30,800
No. No!

3
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:32,761
Hey! Rápido, rápido!
Vamos, vamos!

4
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:50,612
Silencio.

5
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,676
God, please help us. Please, God.
Dear Heavenly Father, please...

6
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:33,238
I know. Oh, my God.
I know. So pretty.

7
00:02:35,282 --> 00:02:37,117
- I just feel like I can't breathe.
- Okay.

8
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,344
- All right, well…
- A little bit.

9
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:40,912
…maybe just take small breaths.
Just like... In and out.

10
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:42,998
Dress is compressing
my diaphragm, you guys.

11
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:45,875
- It's like somebody stole my oxygen.
- Just breathe. Small breaths.

12
00:02:55,343 --> 00:03:00,432
Okay, Amber, you are perfect,
and it is three o'clock.

13
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:01,641
I need a Valium.

14
00:03:03,143 --> 00:03:04,936
Actually, I need my brother.

15
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,022
- Okay. Really?
- We can do that.

16
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:09,774
Yeah, I just need a second...
Need a minute with my brother.

17
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:12,485
- Yeah, let's do it.
- We'll be right there.

18
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:13,987
- Let's go, girls.
- Thank you.

19
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:21,286
- All good?
- Yeah. I mean…

20
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:23,788
They're always late.

21
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:35,967
Give me a minute. All good.

22
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:37,469
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

23
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,524
Wow.

24
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:56,404
Thanks.

25
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:07,999
I just need you to tell me
this is real. It's gonna last.

26
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:13,505
Well, nothing lasts forever,
and he is your first husband.

27
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,799
That's a good point. Yeah.

28
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:22,138
But it's real. It's
love. It's happiness.

29
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:27,018
That's it, Bug. You did it.

30
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:29,145
I know.

31
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:33,942
But, like, I'm not
missing something, right?

32
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:37,320
Yeah, we're different.
Our values...

33
00:04:37,404 --> 00:04:40,490
Prince doesn't like family. He
only sees his dad once a year.

34
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:42,701
He hasn't talked to
his mother in forever.

35
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:44,661
Amber, baby…

36
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:51,126
I'm not worried for you two.
I mean, he's good to you, no?

37
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,464
Prince is a guy who's used
to getting what he wants.

38
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:58,884
You've got spine.

39
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,469
It's gonna be a real
marriage of equals.

40
00:05:03,555 --> 00:05:06,516
You know how much
I love you, right?

41
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:12,939
Nothing's gonna change here.

42
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:15,358
It's always been you and me.

43
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:18,445
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

44
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,072
And Mom.

45
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:35,420
Okay. If I throw you over my
shoulder, this dress will wrinkle.

46
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:37,005
- Okay.
- Okay?

47
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:39,758
Let's go.

48
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:48,266
Wait.

49
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,185
What?

50
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:51,353
One thing's different.

51
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:55,857
He's not just another
guy in your unit.

52
00:05:57,234 --> 00:05:59,069
You need to bring
him back to me.

53
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:03,031
He comes home.

54
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:06,159
Yes or no?

55
00:06:06,952 --> 00:06:08,036
I hear you, Bug.

56
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,831
- Okay.
- Okay.

57
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:40,902
What can I tell you, son?
Happy wife, happy life.

58
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:42,320
Isn't that right?

59
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:44,724
- Congratulations, bud. Great ceremony.
- Hey. Thanks, man.

60
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,741
Well, that's pretty
rich coming from you.

61
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:49,119
Well, after three tries,
trust me, I'm an expert.

62
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:50,287
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

63
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:07,137
Yeah, man. Welcome
to the family.

64
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,680
I know I'm not your father,

65
00:07:09,306 --> 00:07:13,435
but I would like the honor of stepping
in for him today and having this dance.

66
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:15,645
- Would that be possible?
- Yes.

67
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:17,731
- I'll be back, hon.
- Excellent.

68
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:20,650
Anything you need today,

69
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:22,652
- I'm your man, okay?
- Thank you.

70
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,444
Hey, John, I need the
keys to number two.

71
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:06,207
Yeah, we got that up
here for him already.

72
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:14,037
What's going on, Mom?

73
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:17,791
Fresh air. Taking it all in.

74
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:20,544
Enjoying the party?

75
00:08:21,545 --> 00:08:24,506
Not my people. They don't
want me to participate.

76
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,680
Maybe for your daughter's sake,
fake it as a normal person.

77
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:32,764
Lay off the drugs.

78
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:36,726
Or maybe you have a drink.
Might improve your personality.

79
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,981
Now get back in there and do your
job. Take care of your sister.

80
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,943
You're probably
boiling up inside.

81
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:48,530
She married your rich friend.
You still got a job to do.

82
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,409
You make sure he doesn't start
treating her like a piece of property.

83
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:56,079
Is it too soon to
talk about a baby?

84
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:58,766
- It probably is, right? Yeah, maybe...
- Maybe wait till after the wedding?

85
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,710
Or maybe we should... Yeah,
we can wait till tomorrow.

86
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:04,170
I mean, I'm kidding.
I mean, I'm not…

87
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:06,715
- He's a deliberate man.
- Yeah.

88
00:09:06,798 --> 00:09:08,300
He likes to think it through.

89
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:11,970
But the clock is ticking
on the Senate run too.

90
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:16,558
There's nothing more irresistible
than a war hero with a young family.

91
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:19,436
I don't want the window to
close on that opportunity.

92
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:32,240
- Does this remind you of our wedding?
- Nope. A lot of important people here.

93
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:34,659
- You're pretty important too.
- Yeah?

94
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:38,246
You're their leader. All
your boys are growing up.

95
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,420
Son, cut in.

96
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:55,931
Can I get some water, please?

97
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,435
- Brother-in-law, right?
- I am now.

98
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:02,229
Yeah, Roy Leonard.

99
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:04,356
Alex Chesborough.
Call me "Bambi."

100
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,024
- Bambi?
- That's right.

101
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:10,320
Prince tells me you're
ex-New Zealand group?

102
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:12,322
Yeah. That was back
in the day, mate.

103
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:14,699
You know the story. We
ate snakes in the jungle.

104
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:17,661
Yeah. Heard that one. It
tastes like chicken, right?

105
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:15,677
It's an important
step in a man's life

106
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:18,722
when you take a wife and
start a family. Right?

107
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:23,226
Nurturing others, not just yourself.
That's the true mark of manhood.

108
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,562
- Yeah. Cheers to that.
- But remember,

109
00:11:26,563 --> 00:11:29,203
this is the only family you can
call at two o'clock in the morning,

110
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:32,444
say, "I'm fucked up, I crashed the
car, and there's a body in the trunk."

111
00:11:33,737 --> 00:11:36,531
And we're not gonna ask why. We're
gonna say, "What do you need?"

112
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:39,576
Unless you split with my sister.

113
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:41,328
Nah, then we'll just shoot you.

114
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:43,914
A couple times.

115
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:47,208
Well, to murder.

116
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:48,919
- Murder.
- Murder.

117
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:05,393
Yes, sir?

118
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:12,025
Roger that.

119
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:18,406
Prince!

120
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:21,076
Yo, Drifter. Brother!

121
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:24,412
- We got a flyaway.
- Fuck.

122
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:26,581
You have fun tonight. I'll
see you in the morning.

123
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,584
Love you, brother.

124
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:56,236
Listen up. We gotta be
wheels up in eight hours.

125
00:12:57,195 --> 00:13:00,365
We're gonna grab a couple
of our own. No more boozing.

126
00:13:01,116 --> 00:13:02,158
- Yes, sir.
- Copy.

127
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:03,285
Let's roll.

128
00:13:29,436 --> 00:13:31,396
Hey, now you are my North Star.

129
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:35,317
Like a navigation point?

130
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:39,154
- Like a GPS?
- No.

131
00:13:39,237 --> 00:13:43,533
- A nice human computer bringing you home.
- No. Like the sun. Like the moon.

132
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,078
You're the whole universe.

133
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:51,249
I love you.

134
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,751
I love you.

135
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:03,470
Babe?

136
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,058
We have a flyaway…

137
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:11,102
tomorrow.

138
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:12,687
Tomorrow?

139
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:17,192
- Yeah.
- It's already tomorrow.

140
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:21,071
I'm so sorry. Hostage rescue.

141
00:14:25,617 --> 00:14:26,868
I'm so sorry.

142
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:01,403
I have to be on base at 0800.

143
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,365
They let me have the night.

144
00:15:08,618 --> 00:15:09,619
Well…

145
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,002
gives us six hours.

146
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:19,439
- Systems are good.
- …good.

147
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:22,484
Copy. LZ is three minutes out.

148
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:26,571
If it gets much worse
then we have to abort.

149
00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:28,406
- Copy.
- Starting our approach.

150
00:16:37,207 --> 00:16:38,792
ISR has the LZ.

151
00:16:40,752 --> 00:16:42,379
Copy. LZ is clear.

152
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:44,881
- One minute out.
- One minute!

153
00:16:44,965 --> 00:16:46,424
- One minute.
- One minute.

154
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:48,802
One minute.

155
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:50,303
Starting our approach.

156
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:00,689
We're approaching the LZ.

157
00:17:01,314 --> 00:17:03,900
Roger. You should have ISR
coverage in 30 seconds.

158
00:17:04,484 --> 00:17:07,027
- Have eyes on in 30 seconds.
- Thirty seconds!

159
00:17:07,112 --> 00:17:08,530
Thirty seconds!

160
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:12,867
Three, two, one. Doors open.

161
00:17:14,494 --> 00:17:15,786
Doors open.

162
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:20,083
Anything?

163
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,959
Visibility is degrading.

164
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:24,087
Lay low.

165
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,881
Ropes, ropes, ropes.

166
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:27,757
Copy. Ropes coming
out on the left side.

167
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:33,221
- First rope is going out.
- Copy.

168
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:39,436
Prince, wait.

169
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:41,229
This isn't right.
Something's wrong.

170
00:17:41,313 --> 00:17:45,358
The drone is over the wrong
mountain. This LZ is not clear.

171
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:47,044
Get that fucking drone
over the right mountain.

172
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:48,737
Yes, sir. Moving in now.

173
00:17:49,446 --> 00:17:51,948
- Moving down.
- There's movement on the ground.

174
00:17:56,286 --> 00:17:57,954
Taking fire! We're taking fire!

175
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:01,583
Ridgeline. Ridgeline!

176
00:18:02,626 --> 00:18:05,503
Prince is on the rope!
Prince is on the rope!

177
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,847
Okay, we still have an
operator on the rope.

178
00:18:15,931 --> 00:18:17,224
He's off. He's off.

179
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:23,188
Prince, are you all right?

180
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:25,690
I'm good.

181
00:18:25,774 --> 00:18:28,401
- Abort! Abort!
- We've got a man down there!

182
00:18:28,485 --> 00:18:31,696
The bird's damaged. We've gotta
go back to base and transload.

183
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:41,957
Then put me down right here!

184
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,293
You're 1,000 feet of elevation
and half a klick from the target.

185
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:47,337
The snow looks pretty soft.

186
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:49,297
Roger that.

187
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:01,476
Troops are clear.
Troops are clear.

188
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:03,603
Copy that. Let's go.

189
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,529
What's the plan? Do you have me?

190
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:15,323
We're being reinserted
half a klick away,

191
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:16,658
and we're climbing back up.

192
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:17,742
Roger.

193
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:35,760
Good thing we left our
snowshoes on the bird.

194
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:21,473
The hostages are
coming down to you.

195
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:30,315
They're coming down to us.

196
00:20:30,398 --> 00:20:33,735
Might have to choose between getting
the hostages and going for Prince.

197
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:35,320
That's easy. We get our guy.

198
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:38,114
No, mission first.
Prince will have to wait.

199
00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:58,927
Let's set up right here.
They'll walk right to us.

200
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:05,058
Prince, you good?

201
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,062
I'm good, but not
for much longer.

202
00:21:40,051 --> 00:21:43,138
This is bullshit. We're
sitting here, playing commando,

203
00:21:43,221 --> 00:21:45,098
while Prince is up
there by himself.

204
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:15,837
- Prince?
- I'm good. I'm good.

205
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:16,922
Hang tight.

206
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,037
Journalists! Don't shoot!

207
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:51,998
Don't shoot! Journalists!

208
00:22:52,082 --> 00:22:55,585
- US rescue force!
- USA! We're rescue force. You're safe.

209
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:57,003
Command, package secure.

210
00:22:57,087 --> 00:23:00,674
Roger. Gunship had to pull off because
of daylight. Stand by for QRF inbound.

211
00:23:00,757 --> 00:23:02,050
Get 'em down to the bird.

212
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:04,135
We also have movement
coming up the mountain.

213
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,474
- Drifter, I gotta get Prince.
- Okay.

214
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:10,725
We're going for Prince.

215
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:13,562
Drifter, we cannot get any fixed-wing
support in there right now.

216
00:23:13,645 --> 00:23:15,272
Prince is alone up there.

217
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:17,107
On me.

218
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:54,352
I got eyes on our guy.

219
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:57,606
Prince, we have a
visual on you, brother.

220
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,328
Guys, we've got a bunker up
there with a heavy machine gun.

221
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:13,330
I'm not going to be
able to get to you.

222
00:24:13,413 --> 00:24:14,748
You've gotta clear that first.

223
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:20,212
Triple, we gotta leave our own base
and fire so we can get him across.

224
00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:22,672
- We've gotta flank 'em.
- Copy that.

225
00:24:22,756 --> 00:24:25,884
- Bambi, you cover our movements.
- Copy that.

226
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:28,720
- Stay there, Prince.
- Roger.

227
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:51,034
Drifter, you're clear.

228
00:25:03,004 --> 00:25:04,256
Bunker's cleared.

229
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:06,341
Roger. Moving across.

230
00:25:06,424 --> 00:25:08,426
Bambi, I'm coming
back down to you.

231
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:13,139
Drifter!

232
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,852
We got another fighter up there.

233
00:25:17,936 --> 00:25:19,145
Drifter is down.

234
00:25:19,229 --> 00:25:21,856
- Bambi, go to him. Go to him!
- I'm moving!

235
00:25:26,903 --> 00:25:27,904
I'm hit!

236
00:25:29,698 --> 00:25:31,074
Oh, fuck.

237
00:25:31,157 --> 00:25:32,242
You okay?

238
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:34,828
I'm good, I'm
good. Help Drifter.

239
00:25:35,412 --> 00:25:37,414
- Prince is hit.
- Fuck!

240
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:39,332
Foot patrol leaving
the target area.

241
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:41,877
Six or seven fighters going
down to the tree line.

242
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,795
You gotta move. You
don't have much time.

243
00:25:44,588 --> 00:25:46,172
Drifter!

244
00:25:48,884 --> 00:25:49,885
You okay?

245
00:25:52,095 --> 00:25:53,930
Just key in the
comms, "I'm here."

246
00:25:55,724 --> 00:25:58,435
Just move your head.
Move your foot.

247
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:12,324
Bambi, this is Triple. I can't
get back to you, brother.

248
00:26:12,407 --> 00:26:14,284
I'm stuck. I'm at
least ten minutes out.

249
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:18,580
You've got fighters closing in on
Prince's position. Thirty seconds.

250
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:33,178
Just move your foot or your head.
Just key in the comms, "I'm here."

251
00:26:34,095 --> 00:26:35,805
Taliban on you in 20 seconds.

252
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,910
Triple, get back to the bird.
I got Prince. I'm headed down.

253
00:27:09,464 --> 00:27:11,550
Drifter is dead.
We gotta go down.

254
00:27:11,633 --> 00:27:15,178
- Are you sure?
- Drifter is dead. We gotta go.

255
00:27:16,304 --> 00:27:17,556
Fuck! Are you sure?

256
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:45,792
You feel so good.

257
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:48,920
So do you.

258
00:28:17,532 --> 00:28:18,533
Hey.

259
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:21,119
What's wrong?

260
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:24,039
Is it Drifter?

261
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:29,127
Why don't you talk
to Bambi about it?

262
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:02,160
Hey, can I ask you
something about the mission?

263
00:29:07,457 --> 00:29:11,795
I'm trying to piece it together,
but he's not talking to me about it.

264
00:29:21,054 --> 00:29:25,892
He got jammed up, but I was
already over the X by that time.

265
00:29:27,978 --> 00:29:31,439
I was doing my thing.
He was doing his.

266
00:29:39,406 --> 00:29:42,033
I didn't really see Prince
on the op once it started.

267
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:54,004
Yeah. Okay.

268
00:30:12,397 --> 00:30:13,398
Thank you.

269
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:31,166
Thank you both for having dinner
with me. It means a lot to me.

270
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:35,212
- Of course.
- We're here for each other. Right?

271
00:30:35,295 --> 00:30:36,296
That's right.

272
00:30:38,256 --> 00:30:40,634
- How are we this evening?
- Three specials,

273
00:30:40,717 --> 00:30:43,970
and get us a bottle of your most
outrageous cabernet, please.

274
00:30:44,054 --> 00:30:45,430
And some water for this guy.

275
00:30:49,184 --> 00:30:51,228
Turned your back on him
and your meal was gone.

276
00:30:52,812 --> 00:30:55,815
- Really? That's funny.
- Oh, yeah. Every time. Yeah.

277
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:02,113
Took Drifter's boys to
hockey practice today.

278
00:31:03,448 --> 00:31:05,158
First time they'd
been back on the ice.

279
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:09,079
Jason got into a
thing with the coach,

280
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:13,792
but he handled it well.
They're solid boys.

281
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:15,585
They're so strong.

282
00:31:16,503 --> 00:31:20,257
Yeah. Well, they had their
dad for ten, 12 years.

283
00:31:22,592 --> 00:31:25,971
I don't understand. You think it's okay
for a ten-year-old to not have his dad?

284
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:29,140
No.

285
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:34,062
I'm saying they got a lot of
substance from their father already

286
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:35,397
that'll help 'em.

287
00:31:36,565 --> 00:31:37,566
What the f...

288
00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:39,859
People surviving hardship,
Prince. It's pretty common.

289
00:31:39,943 --> 00:31:42,779
Right. I guess you're
the best example.

290
00:31:43,697 --> 00:31:45,365
Well, I'm just a hard dog.

291
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:54,249
What are we gonna do, bub?

292
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:09,639
Maybe you made a mistake.

293
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:13,602
Maybe.

294
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:17,439
You did.

295
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,360
Maybe not.

296
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:29,951
Maybe on the next op, I get
smoked for something you do.

297
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,289
- You're running loops.
- Don't put this on me.

298
00:32:34,372 --> 00:32:36,499
- You're "hypotheticalizing" …
- I'm not the problem.

299
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,668
…and it doesn't
work. You hear me?

300
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,214
And it's gonna get you jammed
up next time we're out.

301
00:32:44,341 --> 00:32:45,759
I'm sorry.

302
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,263
I'm sorry too. But he needs to own
this, otherwise we can't move on.

303
00:32:52,682 --> 00:32:54,893
Accountability is a bitch, man.

304
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:55,977
God.

305
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:59,314
Denial is gonna tear you
up. It's gonna fuck you up.

306
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:01,900
Is that right?

307
00:33:01,983 --> 00:33:05,320
Drifter is dead.
Your friend is dead.

308
00:33:05,403 --> 00:33:07,739
- Do we have to make it about this?
- Grieving widow.

309
00:33:07,822 --> 00:33:09,115
There's two kids.

310
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:11,952
We just need to agree on this,
man, and come clean about it.

311
00:33:21,294 --> 00:33:22,295
I'm gonna go.

312
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:25,799
I'm sorry.

313
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:33,991
You watch your six down there if I
don't see you before you go, okay?

314
00:33:34,015 --> 00:33:35,016
Okay.

315
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:06,965
I'm sorry I was hard on him. I
was just trying to tell the truth.

316
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:08,842
I don't understand
you sometimes.

317
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:11,553
He would do exactly the same to
me if he thought I'd screwed up.

318
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:12,637
No, he wouldn't.

319
00:34:14,014 --> 00:34:16,432
He didn't have to
leave him behind.

320
00:34:22,564 --> 00:34:24,900
Well, maybe it's a good
thing you're getting out now.

321
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:27,235
What's that supposed to mean?

322
00:34:27,318 --> 00:34:29,028
Maybe it's not what
you're meant to do.

323
00:34:29,613 --> 00:34:31,364
- I don't know, jump to politics.
- What?

324
00:34:31,448 --> 00:34:34,576
Whatever it is, you're taking
out your frustrations on Bambi.

325
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,870
You were there too. You
didn't save Drifter.

326
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:40,332
This whole thing falls apart if we
can't be honest with each other.

327
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:43,126
And you're sure this isn't about
competition between you guys?

328
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:45,021
- Is that what you really think of me?
- Just asking.

329
00:34:45,045 --> 00:34:46,796
That's a gross question.

330
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,465
I'm in pain too, but
instead of thinking of that,

331
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:52,635
all you can do is revert
to your redneck loyalty.

332
00:34:54,137 --> 00:34:56,347
Okay, I'm sorry, I know
that's a shitty thing to say,

333
00:34:56,431 --> 00:34:59,851
but you always take your brother's
side, no matter how horrible.

334
00:35:03,939 --> 00:35:06,399
Why did you even marry me if
we're not gonna be a family?

335
00:35:32,342 --> 00:35:33,736
- I shouldn't have said that.
- Admit it.

336
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,178
- I was way out of...
- You like it.

337
00:35:35,262 --> 00:35:38,974
You like my redneck
fucking loyalty.

338
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:43,311
That's true.

339
00:36:16,303 --> 00:36:17,679
What is this doing here?

340
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:23,476
It's a beacon. It's
to keep you safe.

341
00:36:27,355 --> 00:36:30,525
Come on. It's the same as we
carry. It's military grade.

342
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,653
No, thanks.

343
00:36:33,737 --> 00:36:37,407
- You're going to Colombia.
- Right. I've been all around the world.

344
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,284
Your phone isn't gonna
work in the jungle.

345
00:36:39,367 --> 00:36:41,161
This is just basic safety.

346
00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:43,538
Now you think I'm
being controlling?

347
00:36:43,622 --> 00:36:46,875
This is protection against
an emergency. Come on.

348
00:36:48,084 --> 00:36:49,794
I'm concerned is all.

349
00:36:49,878 --> 00:36:50,712
Yeah, well,

350
00:36:50,795 --> 00:36:53,882
you promised me when we got
married you wouldn't do this shit.

351
00:36:53,965 --> 00:36:56,760
All right, so what if
something happens to you?

352
00:36:57,802 --> 00:36:59,262
What is this? What
are you doing?

353
00:36:59,763 --> 00:37:02,390
- You're going out for a run now?
- Yeah.

354
00:37:02,474 --> 00:37:06,686
Isn't that a little dangerous?
Take the dog at least.

355
00:37:10,482 --> 00:37:11,691
I need time alone.

356
00:39:10,101 --> 00:39:11,311
We're fine, right?

357
00:39:12,812 --> 00:39:14,105
Yeah.

358
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:17,150
Hey. Hey.

359
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:20,654
Should I stay and
take care of you guys?

360
00:39:20,737 --> 00:39:23,198
No, come on. We're big boys.

361
00:39:28,411 --> 00:39:32,290
Relax. Everything's
fine. Come on.

362
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:02,237
- Good morning, y'all.
- Morning.

363
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,613
How is everybody today?

364
00:40:03,697 --> 00:40:05,490
- Yeah. Good.
- Good.

365
00:40:05,574 --> 00:40:07,409
Has anyone taken drugs today?

366
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,248
Come on. What about coffee?
'Cause caffeine counts.

367
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:15,292
Nicotine?

368
00:40:16,835 --> 00:40:20,422
How about a little
spoonful of sugar? It is.

369
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:23,967
Sugar affects the brain in the
same way as substances of abuse.

370
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:29,639
You see, the truth is we
all take drugs every day,

371
00:40:29,723 --> 00:40:32,392
but I am here to talk
about the heavy hitters.

372
00:40:33,018 --> 00:40:35,979
Here's a number for you.
Twenty-three million.

373
00:40:36,605 --> 00:40:39,399
That's the number of Americans
who struggle with drug addiction.

374
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:42,819
We're a nation in pain.

375
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:50,785
And this is very personal for me,
because my mother is a drug addict.

376
00:40:51,995 --> 00:40:53,246
And it's frustrating,

377
00:40:53,747 --> 00:40:58,168
because the cure for addiction
is right in front of our faces,

378
00:40:59,127 --> 00:41:00,837
but the scientific community,

379
00:41:00,921 --> 00:41:03,423
we don't want to admit
that there's a cure.

380
00:41:03,506 --> 00:41:04,883
And we don't want to admit it

381
00:41:04,966 --> 00:41:10,180
because then we would be admitting
that these guys were right.

382
00:41:13,266 --> 00:41:15,435
You see, neuroscience tells us

383
00:41:15,518 --> 00:41:20,106
that addiction is a problem of
the brain not being able to change

384
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,692
once it is hooked
onto a substance,

385
00:41:22,776 --> 00:41:26,655
yet we have decades of
research that tell us

386
00:41:26,738 --> 00:41:30,450
psychedelics are the most powerful
mind-altering compounds on this planet.

387
00:41:30,533 --> 00:41:35,664
Now, I am not suggesting we all
drop acid, and we're cured. No.

388
00:41:36,373 --> 00:41:40,752
You need to be in a therapeutic
setting, and you need to be guided.

389
00:41:41,628 --> 00:41:44,965
Fortunately, there are people
that exist on this planet

390
00:41:45,048 --> 00:41:47,509
who know how to use
psychedelics therapeutically.

391
00:41:48,301 --> 00:41:49,719
We call them "shamans."

392
00:41:52,097 --> 00:41:54,391
He must be doing
something right,

393
00:41:54,474 --> 00:41:59,354
because addiction is essentially
unknown in his community.

394
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,400
In fact, it does not exist.

395
00:42:11,032 --> 00:42:13,326
Touch of ginger, bit of soy.

396
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:16,955
Yeah, that's magic.
You are a magician.

397
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:19,249
Nah, I'm just one of the elves.

398
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,918
That's good. We're done.

399
00:42:22,794 --> 00:42:23,879
Bye-bye.

400
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:27,132
Okay, Arthur, lay it on me.

401
00:42:27,215 --> 00:42:31,761
It's our last day in the lab.
I am wide open for advice.

402
00:42:31,845 --> 00:42:33,513
We're gonna have
one of those moments

403
00:42:33,597 --> 00:42:38,435
where the mentor encourages his star
student to believe in her vision.

404
00:42:38,935 --> 00:42:40,520
I believe.

405
00:42:40,604 --> 00:42:45,275
It's everybody else who thinks I'm
crazy for going to South America

406
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:50,488
to study plants and rituals all to
find, you know, cures for addiction.

407
00:42:50,572 --> 00:42:53,199
Yeah, well, we talked
about frontier science.

408
00:42:53,283 --> 00:42:55,744
You're gonna get a lot of
skepticism and ridicule,

409
00:42:55,827 --> 00:42:58,622
but I can see the future,
and in it, you help.

410
00:42:59,998 --> 00:43:03,418
With your grasp of alkaloids, you
could be the next Timothy Leary.

411
00:43:05,462 --> 00:43:08,715
I do like to do good,
but maybe that's vanity.

412
00:43:08,798 --> 00:43:09,799
No.

413
00:43:11,218 --> 00:43:12,219
It's who you are.

414
00:44:14,906 --> 00:44:16,992
I read your study
before you came.

415
00:44:18,368 --> 00:44:19,369
We all did.

416
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:23,999
"Not all frontiers
are in outer space.

417
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:31,965
Alkaloids are the last great black
holes. They must be explored."

418
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:34,551
Thanks.

419
00:44:35,051 --> 00:44:36,428
- Hey, Amber.
- Yeah?

420
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:37,804
We got enough.

421
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:39,180
No, keep going.

422
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:41,600
Be careful.

423
00:44:42,851 --> 00:44:44,436
This is why we came here.

424
00:44:44,978 --> 00:44:46,354
Yeah.

425
00:44:48,106 --> 00:44:49,441
Oh, nice.

426
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:53,987
Okay, guys. Let's go to work.

427
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,864
- Nice.
- These are all mature.

428
00:44:55,947 --> 00:44:56,948
See?

429
00:46:02,055 --> 00:46:05,850
We need your knowledge for
our... for lots of stuff.

430
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:37,132
I have to. I've got
too much work to do.

431
00:46:37,632 --> 00:46:40,719
My family. They're
home, waiting for me.

432
00:46:45,056 --> 00:46:46,474
Always.

433
00:47:01,156 --> 00:47:02,157
Is this one?

434
00:47:03,867 --> 00:47:08,872
Don't rob Peter to
pay Paul. Is it?

435
00:47:09,623 --> 00:47:10,999
Yeah. I think so.

436
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:13,084
You wanna know
what else I think?

437
00:47:13,168 --> 00:47:14,336
No.

438
00:47:15,378 --> 00:47:17,881
You wanna be the boss,
you've gotta pay the cost.

439
00:47:19,591 --> 00:47:23,970
Don't do the crime if
you can't do the time.

440
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,849
Well, some people
don't have a choice.

441
00:47:30,518 --> 00:47:32,312
A man's character
is his destiny.

442
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,695
That's not bad. I
like it. Is it Greek?

443
00:47:41,488 --> 00:47:42,489
Maybe.

444
00:47:46,493 --> 00:47:47,911
You heard from Amber?

445
00:47:49,704 --> 00:47:51,373
She hasn't called
me in a few days.

446
00:47:54,501 --> 00:47:55,919
I knew she'd get in trouble.

447
00:47:57,546 --> 00:47:59,965
Just hope she wasn't
eaten by an alligator.

448
00:48:00,757 --> 00:48:02,801
You know they have 'em
all over the jungle.

449
00:48:03,468 --> 00:48:07,556
Or get bitten by a Zika insect and
she can't have a baby for ten years.

450
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:09,724
How does your
brain even do that?

451
00:48:10,225 --> 00:48:12,227
I read a lot.

452
00:48:14,187 --> 00:48:15,855
They have human slavery

453
00:48:16,439 --> 00:48:19,985
and whore tents in banana fields
where they get you hooked on heroin.

454
00:48:20,068 --> 00:48:21,069
Do they?

455
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:22,779
Open your eyes.

456
00:48:23,572 --> 00:48:28,243
You better go down there. Take
care of your sister, buster.

457
00:48:28,743 --> 00:48:32,330
Why can't we just talk without you
turning everything into the apocalypse?

458
00:48:33,123 --> 00:48:36,334
We don't know nothing
about the dark side, do we?

459
00:48:56,771 --> 00:48:57,772
Hello.

460
00:48:58,607 --> 00:48:59,608
Welcome.

461
00:49:01,985 --> 00:49:03,194
Do we know these guys?

462
00:49:04,237 --> 00:49:05,822
Yeah, they're from the town.

463
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:10,785
I don't know why they're here.

464
00:49:30,222 --> 00:49:33,475
All right. Looks
like they wanna talk.

465
00:49:37,312 --> 00:49:38,647
What's up?

466
00:49:39,439 --> 00:49:40,607
What are you doing out here?

467
00:49:41,233 --> 00:49:43,109
Scientific research.

468
00:49:43,944 --> 00:49:47,113
I talked to the commander.
We already have permission.

469
00:49:47,197 --> 00:49:49,157
We have to check
all your equipment.

470
00:49:49,241 --> 00:49:50,659
Gentlemen,

471
00:49:50,742 --> 00:49:52,827
we are here to work.

472
00:49:53,328 --> 00:49:57,207
I already talked to your guys back at
the village, the letter is authentic.

473
00:49:58,625 --> 00:49:59,626
Here.

474
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:07,968
Take everything out.

475
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:09,052
Check it all.

476
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:13,598
Hey, what are they doing?

477
00:50:14,432 --> 00:50:17,102
Hey, be careful
with the equipment.

478
00:50:17,185 --> 00:50:18,186
Gracias.

479
00:51:01,187 --> 00:51:05,191
God, please help us. Please, God.
Dear Heavenly Father, please…

480
00:51:27,672 --> 00:51:29,758
- Yeah?
- Where are you?

481
00:51:30,884 --> 00:51:31,927
Lakewood.

482
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,553
Have you heard from Amber?

483
00:51:34,179 --> 00:51:35,513
Not in a few days.

484
00:51:36,306 --> 00:51:38,350
We need to meet. How fast
can you be at my house?

485
00:51:47,192 --> 00:51:48,360
You need context.

486
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:52,155
Before she left, I put a
tracking beacon in her bag.

487
00:51:53,323 --> 00:51:54,699
I've been following it daily.

488
00:51:54,783 --> 00:51:57,702
She goes into the jungle for her
research and back out to this camp,

489
00:51:57,786 --> 00:52:00,386
but in the last 24 hours, the
signal hasn't moved. It's been here.

490
00:52:00,914 --> 00:52:03,208
- New camp?
- There's no way to camp here.

491
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:05,171
You see, the signal is
at the bottom of a cliff.

492
00:52:06,169 --> 00:52:07,254
There you go.

493
00:52:07,337 --> 00:52:09,524
She got separated from her
beacon, that's what happened.

494
00:52:09,548 --> 00:52:10,840
It was in her backpack.

495
00:52:11,341 --> 00:52:13,134
- Maybe she tossed it.
- Yeah.

496
00:52:14,177 --> 00:52:17,681
I'm surprised she agreed to carry a
beacon. She's supposed to be sterile.

497
00:52:17,764 --> 00:52:20,183
I just put in her bag. I
mean, she didn't want it.

498
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:22,060
Why would she have
to be sterile?

499
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,854
- For her work.
- What are you talking about?

500
00:52:24,938 --> 00:52:27,357
She doesn't need to be sterile,
she's a fucking scientist.

501
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,840
I don't know what
to tell you, man.

502
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,362
What? What the fuck are you talking
about with her being sterile?

503
00:52:32,445 --> 00:52:33,572
That makes no sense.

504
00:52:34,864 --> 00:52:36,950
There's things you
don't know, I guess.

505
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:39,494
Well, go on.

506
00:52:42,163 --> 00:52:44,833
She's got a side thing she's
doing for the Agency down there.

507
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:48,461
A little work for Mitch. She's
supposed to be sterile for that.

508
00:52:49,504 --> 00:52:53,216
- Is she a field officer?
- No, she's a subcontractor. Small fry.

509
00:52:54,342 --> 00:52:57,429
How it works is they got thousands and
thousands of people all over the world

510
00:52:57,512 --> 00:52:59,699
- collecting information...
- Yeah, I know how the CIA works.

511
00:52:59,723 --> 00:53:01,933
- So it's not that big a deal.
- It's not a big deal?

512
00:53:02,017 --> 00:53:04,895
They put it in a file. Big
data. Nobody looks at it.

513
00:53:04,978 --> 00:53:07,606
You are both fucking liars.

514
00:53:07,689 --> 00:53:11,651
She works for the CIA in whatever
capacity, she should have told me.

515
00:53:11,735 --> 00:53:14,279
And you should have told
me at the very least.

516
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,332
This is delicious.

517
00:53:27,959 --> 00:53:29,127
Where did you get it?

518
00:53:29,211 --> 00:53:30,420
You fucking serious?

519
00:53:30,503 --> 00:53:33,065
Yeah, where did you get it? They don't
sell this imported shit in my store.

520
00:53:33,089 --> 00:53:34,090
Where did you get it?

521
00:53:34,174 --> 00:53:37,469
At a high-end, overpriced
market for rich people.

522
00:53:39,471 --> 00:53:40,472
Exactly.

523
00:53:42,641 --> 00:53:45,602
This started when we were
poor, before she even met you.

524
00:53:45,685 --> 00:53:47,604
That's such a touching story.

525
00:53:47,687 --> 00:53:51,024
No money, no daddy, so
you both became liars.

526
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:54,069
How did they do it? Did they
recruit her outta college?

527
00:53:56,154 --> 00:53:58,156
They get her fellowships,
money, support.

528
00:53:59,741 --> 00:54:02,994
Well, what about Colombia? Is she
taking pictures of sensitive sites?

529
00:54:03,078 --> 00:54:06,706
- I'm calling Mitch. No, she does not.
- That's really fucking dangerous.

530
00:54:08,833 --> 00:54:09,960
Yeah.

531
00:54:17,551 --> 00:54:19,803
- I was just about to call you.
- Well, go.

532
00:54:19,886 --> 00:54:21,179
She and two scientists

533
00:54:21,263 --> 00:54:24,474
got rolled up by an ELN guerrilla
group operating in the area.

534
00:54:24,558 --> 00:54:25,934
We have contacts into them.

535
00:54:26,726 --> 00:54:28,829
We know the leadership. She
had permission to be there.

536
00:54:28,853 --> 00:54:30,689
It was a mistake,
it'll get sorted.

537
00:54:30,772 --> 00:54:37,195
Now, the other two scientists may
have been executed, but she's okay.

538
00:54:37,279 --> 00:54:39,239
American, special status.

539
00:54:39,322 --> 00:54:42,158
I need you to call me every
30 minutes, give me an update.

540
00:54:42,242 --> 00:54:44,119
Roger. I got this. Hang tight.

541
00:55:02,262 --> 00:55:03,422
I'm gonna ask you a question.

542
00:55:03,471 --> 00:55:05,891
I want you to really think
about this before you answer.

543
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,646
How much do you trust
the CIA at this point?
