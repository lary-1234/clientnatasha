1
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,882
Just to be clear,
we can't keep doing this.

2
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:50,676
Yeah.

3
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,761
So, we're cool?

4
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,138
Yeah.

5
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,394
Although, I wasn't being totally honest

6
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,521
when I said
I didn't want anything from you.

7
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,153
I'm not looking for
commitment, obviously.

8
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,446
Or help. I...

9
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,200
I want to throw my hat in the ring.

10
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,871
And when, if you ever want
to explore other people,

11
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,790
I just want a shot.

12
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,792
Do you ever not know what you want?

13
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,461
No.

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,341
Must be amazing.

15
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,095
I'm always trying to figure that out.

16
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,893
My dad had this thing.

17
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:47,024
He said, "I don't know what I want"
is just another way of saying,

18
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,610
"I'm not willing to do what it takes
to get what I want."

19
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,281
You always know what you want.

20
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:59,661
The question.
Are you willing to do what it takes?

21
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,793
I want my wife back.

22
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,929
This fucking heat.

23
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,323
Up and at 'em, Sergeant.

24
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,243
Got business in Medellín, bro.

25
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,458
Not me.

26
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,543
I'm working.

27
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,422
What, on a bender?

28
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,510
Why are you such a choirboy?

29
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,430
Maybe drinking is part of the job.

30
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,936
The fuck's so funny about that?

31
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,104
I thought you wanted a plan.

32
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,398
Already have one.

33
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,109
You're too late.

34
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:42,866
Right.

35
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,668
When was that firefight, man?

36
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,337
Fifty-four days ago.

37
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,717
Wow.

38
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,679
How's the back?

39
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,599
- It's good enough.
- Yeah.

40
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:11,061
Look, man, I had a little chat
with Mitch, and he's here to help us.

41
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:15,148
He's worked up a way to get us
past the outer ring of military security

42
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,775
at that hellhole Amber's in.

43
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,778
And how are you gonna do that?

44
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:22,531
We found a pressure point
inside the Venezuelan government.

45
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,533
We just gotta wrap a guy up.

46
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,704
Let me know how that works out.

47
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,289
In the meantime, when I need you,

48
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:33,083
if I need you,
I'll send up a smoke signal.

49
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,337
- Listen, man, I...
- Look, man, you gotta jet.

50
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,965
You're unraveling my whole
pattern of life by being here.

51
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,885
It's a small town.
Everyone already knows you're here,

52
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,761
and in 30 minutes,
they're gonna know in Venezuela.

53
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,348
Bro, you're a mess. It's concerning.

54
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,312
Don't believe your eyes.

55
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,611
Okay, well, I had to try.

56
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,987
Good.

57
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:03,739
Adiós.

58
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,283
Like I said, stay in touch.

59
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:13,707
Hey, man.

60
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,043
I'm here now.

61
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,171
I should've been here sooner.

62
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,674
Look, I owe you an apology.

63
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,136
But we're gonna work this
and it's gonna get done.

64
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,812
Let's go.

65
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,995
Get out of here.

66
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,250
What the fuck?

67
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,334
Mitch.

68
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,394
Come on, buddy.

69
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,531
Let's go.

70
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,681
No!

71
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:42,856
You better not.

72
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,651
Get out of here!

73
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,862
Fuck!

74
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,628
- Hey.
- This is overkill!

75
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,506
He needs to dry out.

76
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,883
Yeah? You a doctor?

77
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,385
I know my meds.

78
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,303
You've been fucking overdosing me, man.

79
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,638
And you...

80
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:18,517
- You're fucking taking me off the target!
- We launch in 48.

81
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,685
For fuck...

82
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:20,811
Put your purse down.

83
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:28,318
If you want me to stop drinking,
that's easy.

84
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,446
I got an idea.

85
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,950
How about you guys
just grow the fuck up?

86
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,370
Look at what you're doing to me.

87
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,456
I've seen it up close before.
It might take a minute.

88
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,168
I'm not a fucking
animal! I've got rights.

89
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:52,342
I'm gonna eat your eyeballs,
you fucking pantywaist.

90
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,102
What the fuck!

91
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,062
What?

92
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,566
The South will rise again.

93
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,778
Yeah.

94
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,040
Mitch. Oh, Mitch.

95
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,587
Are you playing cards?

96
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,240
Sleeping.

97
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,244
Certainly that kind of night.

98
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:24,059
I wanna untie you,
but no more dumbass. Agreed?

99
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:06,768
That facility where they
keep Amber is a cocaine-shipping hub.

100
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:07,978
It's kinda like a black site.

101
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,147
It's controlled
by this Venezuelan minister.

102
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,648
Guy's name is Tariq Marwan.

103
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,650
He's got complete authority
to redirect the army.

104
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,861
Hell, even let Amber walk out.

105
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,741
This guy is his brother. He's a deejay.

106
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,202
Lives 15 minutes from here.
We're gonna grab him.

107
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:30,918
You're saying grab the brother
and hook him up to a car battery?

108
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,006
Well, maybe Tariq is reasonable.
We just do a trade.

109
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,927
But what if I am talking about that?

110
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,099
What, are you ready
to torture an innocent person?

111
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,603
To bring Amber home.

112
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:52,898
You?

113
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,153
Red is positive. Black is negative.

114
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,176
So we've been researching this
for a couple of weeks,

115
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,011
and we've figured out
this guy's pattern of life.

116
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,223
Our window is a 10 a.m. yoga class,
which is in...

117
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,225
in ten minutes. Yeah.

118
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:30,561
Here's the drone footage.

119
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,188
Target never misses
a morning downward dog.

120
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:34,356
He's got one bodyguard.

121
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,317
Drives a black G-Wagon.
Female. Carries a 9-millimeter.

122
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,488
She picks him up here
every day same time, his apartment.

123
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:42,573
And we can't hit him here

124
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,658
because there's CCTV cameras
up and down the street

125
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,785
facing both directions,
and she switches up the routes.

126
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,579
But once she gets close,

127
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,914
there's only one intersection
that isn't totally congested.

128
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:57,004
This one right here.
That's where we take him.

129
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,882
There's only one camera,
facing north and west.

130
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,342
So if we come in from the south side,
we should be clear.

131
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,469
What if you missed a camera?

132
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,180
Then we're fucked.

133
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,660
Here we go.

134
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,357
Standard G-Wagon.

135
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,526
No armor underneath.

136
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:06,740
No other passengers,
and the windows are also standard.

137
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,033
No armor on the sides.

138
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:36,645
That's his bodyguard.

139
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:14,099
This is the longest fucking yoga class
in history.

140
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,106
Our boy's Oscar Mike.

141
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,326
All right. Here we go.

142
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,871
What are the rules of engagement?

143
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,165
Batman.

144
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,584
Batman?

145
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,462
Nobody good gets hurt. Batman rules.

146
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,255
The Superman rules...

147
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,760
You remember. He could destroy
a whole city just to save one person.

148
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,222
Weapons in the back.

149
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:56,099
Focus up.
We're coming up on our intersection.

150
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:05,400
Is this traffic gonna fuck us?

151
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,910
Okay, we're still good. Next block.

152
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,118
Roger.

153
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:25,671
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Fuck.

154
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,980
No, you wait! Go back! Go back!

155
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:46,066
Woman, you have to go. Come on. Just go.

156
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,820
Come on. Back up.

157
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,614
Come on. Come on.

158
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,577
- Fucking Christ.
- Hey, stop.

159
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,078
- What?
- Camera right behind you.

160
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,997
- Did it clock me?
- Not sure. Just get in.

161
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,055
We just missed our window.

162
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,065
We're done for today. Pull over.

163
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:33,906
Fucking hell.

164
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:35,490
Hey.

165
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,994
Colombia's got to be
all over this right now.

166
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,704
We'll reset. Hit them tomorrow.

167
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,042
I need a beat to process.

168
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,550
What about the soccer stadium? He's
doing sound checks for a performance.

169
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,971
No.

170
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,517
It's still our best shot.
He's right there.

171
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,312
People will see us.
They will video us. They will object.

172
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,732
And there will be security cameras
that will definitely get you.

173
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:13,529
It's guaranteed my face
is already with Colombian Intelligence.

174
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,615
And now we're talking heavy crime
in broad daylight.

175
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,784
That move will implicate you forever.

176
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,870
Colombia doesn't have
an extradition treaty with the US.

177
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:24,414
Yeah, but you're branded, man.
You're on the run.

178
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,502
You can't work for a public company,
even if your father is the chairman.

179
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,921
You can't run for elected office.

180
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:35,968
Think about it.

181
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:40,264
You got a big life ahead of you, dude.
Don't fuck it up.

182
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:43,809
I don't have a choice.

183
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,313
I have to get her out.

184
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:55,070
I know.

185
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:01,118
Look, I've got another way
into this prison, which...

186
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:02,828
I was trying to tell you

187
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,163
before you fucking drugged me
and chained me to a bed.

188
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:06,832
Much simpler.

189
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:13,088
I know a guy
who sells fish to the staff there...

190
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:15,299
- Sells fish?
- ...and he can get me in quickly. Quietly.

191
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,384
- Fish?
- Yeah. Fish.

192
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,762
Trying to make it sound good in my head.
I just...

193
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,598
- For fuck's sake, man.
- I just can't.

194
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,391
You honestly like that better

195
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,685
than thumping the brother
of the guy who runs the place?

196
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:27,603
We can get this.

197
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:36,278
All right. I'll leave
it to you and Mitch.

198
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:40,699
No, we need to do this together.

199
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:42,284
I need you.

200
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,536
Are you my brother or what?

201
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,831
Are we family or was all that bullshit?

202
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,178
All right.

203
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:03,514
All right, brother.

204
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:06,475
I'm with you.

205
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:08,852
I'll get Mitch.

206
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:09,937
Hold on.

207
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,320
We didn't really have her in the jungle.

208
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,031
We were close,

209
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,868
but it wasn't dialed, and...

210
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:28,580
I was impulsive.

211
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,584
- Right.
- Yeah.

212
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,883
I cheated on your sister.

213
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:51,645
Just an affair?

214
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,313
Yeah, of course, man. It's just...

215
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:54,898
Yeah, well, don't tell her.

216
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,652
And for what it's worth...

217
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,153
Huh?

218
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:04,074
...I should have told you
what she was doing for the Agency.

219
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:08,495
Okay, man.

220
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:11,290
- All right. We good?
- Yeah.

221
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:12,374
Anything else?

222
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,793
We're good.

223
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:16,211
- We're good. Come on.
- Come on.

224
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:17,671
Let's get the fuck out of here.

225
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:18,964
You guys kiss and make up?

226
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:17,439
There he is.

227
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,025
We should try to get him off that stage,

228
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,652
at least a little out of view.

229
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:40,754
We got an ambulance in the east lot.
You thinking what I'm thinking?

230
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:44,508
I like that.
Trojan horse for the exfil. Get it.

231
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:45,592
Roger.

232
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:58,313
Wanna get closer?

233
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:17,291
Momo, the press is ready for you.

234
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:36,119
Hey.

235
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:41,458
Let's dose his water bottle.

236
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,215
There any polyethylene glycol
or lactitol in that kit?

237
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,299
We got both.

238
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,385
Get him to a bathroom.

239
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:54,638
Bring me a loaded syringe, five cc's.

240
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,265
And when you're ready,

241
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,559
meet us at the fence,
west side, second floor.

242
00:25:58,642 --> 00:25:59,643
On its way.

243
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:52,404
- Gonna go check out that ambulance.
- Roger.

244
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:14,718
- Hi, man.
- How much action do you usually get?

245
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,720
- Concerts like this...
- What is that deejay?

246
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,639
Deejay Momo. Never heard of him?

247
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:20,641
- Check it out.
- Momo.

248
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:23,769
I've actually never seen this guy
perform on stage.

249
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:25,187
Yeah?

250
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,272
Missing out, man.
This guy's the next big thing.

251
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,319
That's a great show.

252
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:33,737
- Yeah, you like it?
- Yeah.

253
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,656
- Let me show you another song.
- I've never seen this.

254
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,241
It's the one that made him famous.

255
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:33,046
Man.

256
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,550
Stand by.
We have a security guard following us.

257
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:37,926
Roger.

258
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,887
Listen, the guy is my size, bro.

259
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:42,931
- It's perfect. Come on.
- That's just adding another layer, man.

260
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:45,726
Dude, we take him. We roll fast.

261
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:48,937
Where do we dump him?

262
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:51,940
You run ahead, find a spot.
I'm not supposed to run.

263
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:57,112
Well, let's just do it together.

264
00:28:57,863 --> 00:28:59,489
Really fast and violent.

265
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:21,803
I know you're in pain.

266
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:25,015
No more moving. No more pain.

267
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:45,994
Ambulance is good to go.

268
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:22,865
Sorry, sir.

269
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:24,449
This is important.
I'm the doctor from Avco.

270
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:26,910
We just need
to do a test before you can perform.

271
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:29,663
You can't be here.

272
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:32,791
Hi, I'm from Avco. The
insurance company.

273
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,377
We have to do a mandatory physical.

274
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,629
- We do all the events.
- We've never heard of this.

275
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:40,632
- You need to leave.
- I'm doing my job, ma'am.

276
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:41,800
Are you gonna push me?

277
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:43,802
Are you okay with this, sir?

278
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:46,430
- It's your health we're worried about.
- I'll escort you out. Escort you out.

279
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:48,140
- Every performer has to do this.
- Don't get me mad.

280
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:49,766
All right, okay. All right.

281
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,019
I'm sorry.

282
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:54,688
Yeah, yeah.

283
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,567
Who the fuck was that?

284
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,250
I put it in the water.

285
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:17,294
When he drinks,
he's gonna be in a world of pain.

286
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,588
Bathroom on the second deck.

287
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:56,708
Momo! Momo!

288
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:57,960
I'm fine, I'm fine!

289
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:00,712
I'll be waiting outside.

290
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:03,757
You ok?

291
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:05,133
Yes!

292
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:06,635
I'm taking a shit!

293
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:11,390
I'm sorry.

294
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:12,307
- This one is occupied.
- No.

295
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:14,059
- Sorry.
- No.

296
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:16,812
Hey.

297
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:19,398
I just saw him running up here.

298
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:20,482
Oh, God.

299
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:24,111
Sorry. Is there anything I can do?

300
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,491
In here.

301
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,546
- Mr. Momo, sir.
- Yeah?

302
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:44,339
Remember me? It's the doctor.

303
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:45,924
No, no. I'm okay.

304
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:49,636
It's okay, sir.
This happens more than you might think.

305
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:52,556
I mean, if you want,
we have something that can help you.

306
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:57,102
No, no. I'm fine.

307
00:32:57,186 --> 00:32:58,312
- Okay.
- Okay?

308
00:32:58,395 --> 00:32:59,396
All right.

309
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:01,982
I was just taking a shit!

310
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,026
Let's go.

311
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:08,322
I'm parked
at exit four with the ambulance.

312
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,324
- Orit!
- She's over here.

313
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:14,036
Oh, Jesus, man.
I don't know what the fuck did I eat.

314
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:16,747
Where are we going?

315
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:19,124
We're going to the infirmary, sir.
It's a stadium policy.

316
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:20,417
Just need to check you out.

317
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:24,129
- But this is the exit, idiot.
- That's right. I'm sorry. You're right.

318
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:27,216
Okay. You don't need to touch me, okay?

319
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:28,383
You don't need to hold my arm.

320
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:33,138
Too much activity at four.
We're looking for a new exfil.

321
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:36,141
Carlita, my love.

322
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:37,809
How are you?

323
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:38,810
- Fine and you?
- I'm fine.

324
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:39,770
I'm fine. Let's go.

325
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:41,104
- What's going on?
- No, I'm fine.

326
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,357
He's not very well, ma'am.
Probably got stomach flu.

327
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,984
- We just need to get him checked out.
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

328
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:48,278
What the fuck, bro? What the fuck?

329
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,989
- Have you seen Orit?
- No, why? What happened?

330
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:52,783
Hey, Mitch, we lost him.

331
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:54,826
This place is too crowded.
We're back to square one.

332
00:33:57,663 --> 00:33:59,248
What the fuck is up with this place?

333
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:00,791
Look, you told me it was safe.

334
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:03,293
I've been here an hour and
I've already shit my pants.

335
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:07,965
And there are two fucking gringos
following me all over the place.

336
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:11,342
Move your ass and figure it out.
That's what I pay you for!

337
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:12,511
Motherfucker!

338
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,638
Fucking managers.

339
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:25,690
This guy's disgusting.

340
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:27,985
He just had diarrhea,
and now he's gonna have sex.

341
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:31,655
He's gonna take her somewhere private.

342
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:33,739
Yeah.

343
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:51,466
Dude.

344
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:07,691
What the fuck? What the fuck?

345
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:09,860
Shut up!

346
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:12,571
Don't move!

347
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:15,157
What's going on, man?

348
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:17,117
They're kidnapping me!

349
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:18,619
Momo!

350
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:38,096
What the fuck?

351
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:42,392
- Let's go, let's go.
- Go!

352
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:32,961
Please, sign in.

353
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:36,006
I'm taking him to see the Minister.

354
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:52,397
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

355
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:55,108
Hi. Welcome.

356
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:57,486
Please, have a seat.

357
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:03,575
It's so nice
to have the State Department here.

358
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:08,038
I'm always telling my people,
"Gringos will come back."

359
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:09,373
And here you are.

360
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:12,000
So, how can I help you?

361
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:16,004
Shall I turn off the recorder?

362
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:20,425
Sure. Saves me
having to delete the file.

363
00:38:21,343 --> 00:38:23,428
All set, my friend.

364
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:27,391
This conversation is ours alone.

365
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:28,976
Perfect.

366
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:31,895
Sir, I won't bullshit you.

367
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:35,524
The bottom line is, I know who you are.
You know who I am.

368
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:38,443
And I'm coming here to you
because I know you can move mountains.

369
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,947
I need your help
with the American you have.

370
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,908
The woman. Amber Chesborough Haas.

371
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:48,662
She's a priority to me personally.

372
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:51,790
You have my professional sympathies.

373
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,292
Sir.

374
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:58,172
I'm begging you for mercy.

375
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:00,299
My mercy?

376
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:04,553
I hope I can help. What do you need?

377
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:05,971
Her freedom.

378
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,265
She needs to come home.

379
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:10,142
Let me tell you something, friend.

380
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:17,524
What you ask is not possible
because that woman is a criminal.

381
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:22,863
Sadly, I have no control over
the criminal process in this country.

382
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:25,073
I think you're being
far too modest, sir.

383
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:26,158
I'm not.

384
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:28,827
We are talking about a woman,

385
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:32,414
but in the larger sense,
we are talking about Colombia

386
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:37,169
and relation with Venezuela
and the role of the CIA.

387
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:39,796
Your CIA.

388
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:46,845
Which I'm afraid is a stain on Colombia.
A tragedy for the entire region.

389
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:50,015
And the reason you have to understand...

390
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:52,684
Go on.

391
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:55,604
The government of Colombia is weak.

392
00:39:56,104 --> 00:40:00,526
Thousands of square miles
in that country are ungoverned.

393
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:02,819
No services, no law.

394
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:06,823
There are places where they
don't even have the presence of police.

395
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:08,075
Can you imagine?

396
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:10,786
Of course you can imagine.

397
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:13,830
And you have to give
the people an enemy.

398
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:15,582
This isn't about politics.

399
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:16,667
It is.

400
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:22,047
Because you choose us, in Venezuela,
as an invented enemy.

401
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,257
We should be brothers,

402
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:27,302
but Colombia needs us
to be at each other's throats,

403
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:32,599
and the CIA works hand in glove
with this scheme to make us the enemy.

404
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:39,523
So, they send agents against us,
like your friend's wife,

405
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:41,233
to destabilize.

406
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:44,361
And this is the purpose of espionage.

407
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:48,031
So, what can we do but defend ourself?

408
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:54,454
With one call,
you could have her released.

409
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,876
We'll pick her up on the Colombia side.
How about that?

410
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,798
I'll pay for the call.

411
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:28,697
Is he safe?

412
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:30,824
Tit for tat, motherfucker.

413
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:34,286
If she's not released
the next time I come here...

414
00:41:36,288 --> 00:41:38,498
I'm gonna have
your brother's fucking head in a bag.

415
00:41:45,731 --> 00:41:51,004
