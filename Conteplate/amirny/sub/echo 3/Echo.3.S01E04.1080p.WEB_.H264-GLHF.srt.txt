1
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:16,620
We have to
decide how we're going to kill this bitch.

2
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:19,204
I know Fami's death affected you deeply.

3
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,040
It hurt us all.

4
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,168
We can figure it out
when we get to the compound.

5
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,379
Let's kill her,
record it and see if that makes an impact.

6
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:28,798
Let's do it now!

7
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:35,889
Let's go!

8
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:37,555
Vámonos.

9
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:38,617
Go.

10
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:06,062
A little step. One more.

11
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:13,777
Go.

12
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:35,925
I got Amber!

13
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:49,957
Relax.

14
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,461
You made the right decision
not to kill her.

15
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,093
Let her rot in there.
It's worse than death.

16
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,816
We know where they are taking her.

17
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,110
A cocaine place full of Venezuelan army.

18
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:01,947
My friend,

19
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,656
let's not wait.

20
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,367
They killed my men.

21
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,911
They have to be punished, and they will.

22
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:09,745
But the General is right.

23
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:12,081
We cannot engage
on this side of the border.

24
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,696
Attacking a facility
on this side of the border,

25
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:45,865
so closely tied
to the Venezuelan government,

26
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,826
would be seen as an act of war.

27
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:53,831
As Colombian Army,
this is as far as we can go for now.

28
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:58,461
It's time to go home
and face the politicians.

29
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:01,714
Let's go.

30
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:03,841
I'm staying.

31
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:06,720
By yourself? That's not a good idea.

32
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:11,348
I can't go back without her.
You know that.

33
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,279
Good luck.

34
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:29,492
Thank you.

35
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,181
Rápido, rápido.

36
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:53,886
I had her, Dad.

37
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:58,432
In my arms. So close.

38
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,354
I could feel her breathing on my back.

39
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,322
I can imagine.

40
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,206
She's brilliant.

41
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,210
She's the purest soul I ever met.

42
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:31,799
She's a liar.

43
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:34,094
She is a liar.

44
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:41,183
That's a big lie, working for the CIA.

45
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:47,399
It's not like, you know,
lying about some old boyfriend's big dick.

46
00:10:53,697 --> 00:10:55,322
I don't know how you trust that.

47
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,580
Reminds me of the, uh…

48
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:11,380
wisdom of one of my mentors, Kenny Rogers.

49
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:27,938
Know when to run.

50
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,350
Come on. Come on.

51
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:07,645
Go on.

52
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:15,027
Yeah.

53
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,600
I'm in pain too,
but instead of thinking of that,

54
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:48,769
all you can do is revert
to your redneck loyalty.

55
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:52,065
You promised me when we got married
you wouldn't do this shit.

56
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:54,900
She's got a side thing she's doing
for the Agency down there.

57
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:56,068
Special status.

58
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:58,028
I've been all around the world.

59
00:12:58,113 --> 00:13:01,323
You guys are both fucking liars.

60
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:04,995
They could hold her for 20 years
or they could kill her tomorrow.

61
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,344
Know when to run.

62
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,089
All right, talk to me.

63
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:04,798
So the book on that place

64
00:16:04,883 --> 00:16:08,886
says it's like FedEx for the Venezuelan
drug cartel run by the military.

65
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,306
It's called Cartel de los Soles,
the Cartel of Suns,

66
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:12,765
which, if you didn't already know,

67
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:16,061
is run all the way to the top
of the Venezuelan government.

68
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:17,312
Security is strong.

69
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,676
That's army on the outside
if you haven't already noticed.

70
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:22,418
Also, I feel the need to point out
that that's where they pay out ELN,

71
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:23,878
so there's gonna be guerrillas
hanging around.

72
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:26,196
- Blah, blah, blah.
- Those guys are no joke.

73
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,114
I can knock it over in a couple of months.

74
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:31,033
How? There's no support
within the administration on this.

75
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,495
The White House
doesn't even wanna hear about her.

76
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:36,538
They won't engage,
no matter what any of us do.

77
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,417
So, uh, what about Ground Branch?

78
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,340
No appetite. It's gonna sound harsh, man,
but, uh, not every problem has a solution.

79
00:16:45,423 --> 00:16:47,509
I'll tell you another problem
without a solution.

80
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,220
When you wake up one morning
with a Glock in your mouth.

81
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:52,556
You notice I said "Glock," not "cock"?

82
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,764
And let me tell you,

83
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:57,476
it won't feel good when that bullet opens
up your fucking skull like a watermelon.

84
00:16:57,561 --> 00:16:59,400
That would be very traumatizing
for my husband.

85
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:01,313
- Oh, yeah.
- Listen, I'm not giving up.

86
00:17:01,398 --> 00:17:06,026
Seventh floor is aware and concerned,
but for the moment, you're on your own.

87
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:28,257
Shall we order in tonight?

88
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,820
Cleaned up enough messes for one day.

89
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,095
Talk to me.

90
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,560
It's Amber.

91
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:43,898
They're forcing me to bury her. Bambi too.

92
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,609
What? What do you mean? Where is she?

93
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:50,905
In some Venezuelan hellhole.
A drug facility.

94
00:17:52,115 --> 00:17:54,241
He's wandering around like a lost dog.

95
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,578
Well, you can't do that.

96
00:17:59,623 --> 00:18:00,999
Amber's our friend.

97
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,961
And Bambi, Jesus Christ, Mitch,
he saved your life.

98
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:07,588
I mean, you gotta get him outta there.

99
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:10,008
Come on. It's not some eternal debt.

100
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:15,387
Pretty sure he can take care of himself.
He's fucking Rambo.

101
00:18:21,728 --> 00:18:25,315
She knew the risks.
It's what she signed up for.

102
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:30,903
You've known her for 15 years.
Amber's not just a friend. She's family.

103
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:33,490
I'm just as upset about this as you are.

104
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:36,076
There's nothing I can do, David.

105
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:40,747
Is... Is everybody in your life
just an asset?

106
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,749
Am I?

107
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:46,877
Look, I have a job, and my job
is to consider the biggest picture.

108
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:49,548
And in the big picture,
it's easier if she stays.

109
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:51,383
I'm sorry to say it, but it is.

110
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:53,259
Plus, the upside,

111
00:18:53,343 --> 00:18:54,927
from a national security perspective…

112
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,765
…the longer she stays in that prison,
the clearer it becomes how awful Maduro is

113
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,182
when it comes to human rights!

114
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:04,061
And you're being a careerist weasel!

115
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:08,441
Wow. Must be nice to be able
to take the moral high ground, hmm?

116
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,402
Make you feel all warm and cozy inside.

117
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:13,613
You know, I'd love to be up there too,
but unfortunately, I took an oath.

118
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:15,865
Yeah. I know all about it.

119
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:17,784
No, no. No. You'll listen.

120
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,161
The oath I took for my job, hmm?

121
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:24,332
What was it? Let's see.
Hard to remember. Oh, yeah.

122
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:28,752
Defend this country against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

123
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,047
Bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

124
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:32,923
I take this obligation freely,

125
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:36,760
without any mental reservation,
et cetera, et cetera, so help me, God.

126
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:42,683
It doesn't say jack shit in there
about being a good person.

127
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,730
Now I don't want you to get
the wrong idea about me or nothing,

128
00:20:51,795 --> 00:20:52,921
but, uh…

129
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:56,215
I'm not a drunk.

130
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:58,969
It's okay. Jesus doesn't judge.

131
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,223
I've saved some people.

132
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:08,435
Lot of people owe their lives.

133
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:12,106
And they like me.

134
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:26,704
Are you DEA?

135
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:32,126
Do I look like I give a shit
about cocaine?

136
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,884
I was a soldier.

137
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:43,054
- A soldier?
- Long time ago.

138
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:44,847
What do you do now?

139
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:52,188
I'm in tourism.

140
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:56,317
People wanna see the authentic Colombia.

141
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:59,028
For the sunsets.

142
00:22:01,948 --> 00:22:04,534
Landscapes.

143
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:07,953
You know, people, they look at this forest

144
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:12,208
and they go, "How beautiful."
"How beautiful"?

145
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:18,423
I just see trees and plants,
all fighting each other for the sunlight.

146
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:23,761
All of them just racing
to the top of the canopy.

147
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,807
And then the slow growers, they just…

148
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:31,978
die in the shade.

149
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:36,857
"Let not your hearts
be troubled. Neither let them be afraid."

150
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:42,489
That's John. Right?

151
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:45,032
Anyway, it was somewhere, but…

152
00:22:46,242 --> 00:22:47,661
You're a believer.

153
00:22:50,163 --> 00:22:51,163
That's great.

154
00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:53,791
Well, God or the Devil.

155
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:56,920
Depends which side of the gun
you're on.

156
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,880
You're gonna fucking learn!

157
00:23:03,134 --> 00:23:04,760
I don't know.

158
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,222
I've killed too many men in my life.

159
00:23:08,306 --> 00:23:10,349
Stay fucking down!

160
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:12,227
I've told you about wearing those shorts!

161
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:13,310
Shut up!

162
00:23:14,104 --> 00:23:17,190
Stay the fuck down!

163
00:23:17,273 --> 00:23:18,983
See what I'm saying?

164
00:23:20,652 --> 00:23:22,487
I was eight. You know?

165
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,200
You know what?

166
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:31,288
I'm a pretty good...
I'm a pretty good shot.

167
00:23:32,163 --> 00:23:35,458
Wanna know the secret? Repeatability.

168
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:41,714
You gotta hold the weapon
the exact same way every time.

169
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:45,676
Fuck it, you're gonna learn now!

170
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,887
You're gonna fucking learn...

171
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:49,890
Yes.

172
00:23:53,852 --> 00:23:55,103
You're a protector.

173
00:23:58,315 --> 00:24:00,442
Your family must be really happy
to have you.

174
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,411
Let's sleep together.

175
00:24:14,455 --> 00:24:15,999
I should make you a hamburger.

176
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:35,644
You know what?

177
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:37,811
I should've played baseball.

178
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:38,730
Hmm.

179
00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:41,607
I had a 72-mile-an-hour fastball
when I was 14.

180
00:24:45,862 --> 00:24:47,279
That's really good, by the way.

181
00:24:57,457 --> 00:24:59,291
Finish outside.

182
00:25:01,044 --> 00:25:03,255
Go. Go play baseball outside.

183
00:25:43,878 --> 00:25:45,505
Finally.

184
00:27:13,843 --> 00:27:15,135
How did I get here?

185
00:27:16,346 --> 00:27:17,763
I found you in the street.

186
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:21,809
Well, thank you for rescuing me.

187
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,105
I didn't think I'd made
such a good first impression.

188
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:32,112
You hungry?

189
00:27:38,034 --> 00:27:40,161
It's…

190
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,624
From my cousin, Javi. He's a fisherman.

191
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,376
Oh.

192
00:27:50,005 --> 00:27:53,465
"Follow me
and I will make you fishers of men."

193
00:28:29,961 --> 00:28:31,880
Where does he get so much fish?

194
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:35,592
Next to the bridge,
where the current slows down.

195
00:28:36,718 --> 00:28:37,969
By the big bridge?

196
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:40,846
Yes, but you can't go there.

197
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:45,477
Fishermen are very territorial,
especially Javi.

198
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,034
Buenos días.

199
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,417
Buenos días.

200
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:17,299
This is where I fish, my friend.

201
00:29:17,884 --> 00:29:21,762
You want me to, uh, swim over
to the other side and fish from Venezuela?

202
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:24,557
That's not my problem, man.

203
00:29:27,685 --> 00:29:29,270
Aren't rivers for everyone?

204
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,567
This is where the currents converge.

205
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:38,738
A man must fish where the fish are.

206
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:48,623
A man has to be careful.

207
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,917
This is my spot.

208
00:29:55,505 --> 00:30:00,634
Well, how about you take
all the fish that I get,

209
00:30:02,304 --> 00:30:03,888
and you just give me ten dollars?

210
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,531
What's your name?

211
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:23,616
Javi.

212
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:27,412
Me llamo Bambi.

213
00:30:31,374 --> 00:30:33,417
It's funny, right?

214
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,920
I'm gonna make you rich.

215
00:30:35,545 --> 00:30:37,547
Rich? How?

216
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:39,173
- How?
- Yeah.

217
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,800
With money.

218
00:30:44,721 --> 00:30:46,640
Good.

219
00:30:47,307 --> 00:30:49,308
- See you tomorrow.
- Mañana.

220
00:30:49,976 --> 00:30:51,560
Mañana, amigo.

221
00:31:09,287 --> 00:31:10,704
Okay.

222
00:31:10,788 --> 00:31:11,873
Do you know what?

223
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:15,376
- What? Tell me.
- Cumbia is the best music in the world.

224
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:26,304
Look at this.

225
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:05,468
- Salud.
- Good. Good job.

226
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:14,269
Let's have beer.

227
00:32:43,256 --> 00:32:45,925
We got five million in
the campaign exploratory account.

228
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:48,220
That's ten times what anybody else has.

229
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:51,431
We got some heavy hitters coming in.
Lot of White House experience.

230
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:52,950
You're gonna have big guns behind you.

231
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:53,974
Right. Good.

232
00:32:54,601 --> 00:32:56,728
What's the matter?
Your head still in Colombia?

233
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,980
I know you gotta be torn up inside.

234
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:00,190
Let's not do that.

235
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:02,150
- What?
- Talk about emotion.

236
00:33:02,233 --> 00:33:03,234
Okay, tough guy.

237
00:33:04,443 --> 00:33:08,573
But you need to understand
she is not coming out. Ever.

238
00:33:08,656 --> 00:33:09,824
We did the research.

239
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:11,910
I spoke to the White House.

240
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:17,790
It is very sad. I liked her a lot,
but she is not coming home.

241
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:22,878
Well, now it's time
to move to the grown-ups' table

242
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:27,092
and make some decisions about your life
before life makes the decisions for you.

243
00:33:27,884 --> 00:33:29,469
I'll do my best to make you happy.

244
00:33:31,637 --> 00:33:32,846
Christ.

245
00:33:33,431 --> 00:33:36,768
When did you get so cynical?

246
00:33:37,352 --> 00:33:39,813
I don't know. Maybe at Harvard.

247
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:43,942
It's fine. I just wanted to be clear.

248
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:46,318
No, maybe you're right.

249
00:33:47,153 --> 00:33:51,031
Maybe everybody's just,
you know, operating out of self-interest.

250
00:33:51,115 --> 00:33:53,117
- Maybe family is just some…
- Mm-hmm.

251
00:33:53,201 --> 00:33:58,373
…sentimental construct to justify some
heartless animal kingdom crap.

252
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:01,876
Maybe real love doesn't exist at all,
but I want you to remember,

253
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,837
I... I taught you
how to wipe your own ass.

254
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:07,840
I had your shit on my fingers.

255
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:11,469
And if you think that wasn't out of love,
you need to grow the fuck up.

256
00:34:12,762 --> 00:34:16,056
Cynicism is a refuge
for the young and the childless.

257
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:26,610
Um, too much?

258
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,862
No.

259
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:33,699
Senator,
I hope we didn't keep you waiting.

260
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,036
Outside of the development team,

261
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,038
you're gonna be
the first to know about this.

262
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:41,081
- If you don't like it, I'll be devastated.
- Well, it's not up to me.

263
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:43,518
Let's see where the warfighters put it
on their list of priorities.

264
00:34:43,543 --> 00:34:45,146
Speaking of which, we have one right here.

265
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,438
- He's not the Joint Chiefs…
- Senator.

266
00:34:46,463 --> 00:34:48,172
…but he knows the truth on the ground.

267
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:51,760
I wasn't expecting to see you.
We're all very sorry for your loss.

268
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:52,844
Thank you.

269
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:54,887
I had an epiphany this morning
about politics,

270
00:34:54,971 --> 00:34:57,097
and I wanted you
to be the first to hear about it.

271
00:34:57,181 --> 00:35:01,894
My father... dad,
does not know what I'm about to say.

272
00:35:01,978 --> 00:35:03,313
I'm intrigued.

273
00:35:05,815 --> 00:35:08,275
I've been exploring a run
for the Senate seat opening up.

274
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,655
- Whoa.
- Could we talk about your support?

275
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:13,657
I would love to talk to you about it.

276
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:18,494
That's how you make history, kids.
Got a future president here.

277
00:35:18,577 --> 00:35:20,454
Senator, I know your time is short.

278
00:35:20,538 --> 00:35:21,998
Reese, wanna kick it off?

279
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:26,168
Senator, may we introduce you to Ulysses?

280
00:35:45,355 --> 00:35:47,065
"You feel it in your bones."

281
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:50,943
When that call comes in,
it's the tone of voice,

282
00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:53,320
and you know something bad has happened.

283
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:58,742
When you hear,
'Your wife has been kidnapped.'

284
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:03,206
And it has shattered your core,

285
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:07,835
"and makes you mad at God, and you say,
'How can God be good?'"

286
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:11,755
And then you segue.
People like vulnerability.

287
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,635
"And you take the lessons
that life has given you."

288
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:18,471
Everybody has loss.

289
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:22,391
Some people's loss is worse than yours.

290
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:26,771
I think about a woman who's lost her child
because of substandard medical care,

291
00:36:26,855 --> 00:36:29,315
"and I know that I wanna fight her fight."

292
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:35,989
"And along with that is the importance
of stronger national security."

293
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:41,619
Americans should be free
to travel safely all around the globe.

294
00:36:42,454 --> 00:36:47,166
"And when anyone threatens that,
they should fear our wrath."

295
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:52,297
Make it your own, of course,
but something like that.

296
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:22,534
Hey, Boss. You got a sec?

297
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:27,081
Got a confession to make.

298
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:28,875
You got five minutes.

299
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:32,503
So, our hero gets picked up
by jungle bros we know are ELN.

300
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:34,297
Okay, you can assume I paid attention.

301
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,717
Right. They drop her off in this
facility run by the Venezuelan military.

302
00:37:38,802 --> 00:37:40,719
That suggests to me
they consider her a keeper.

303
00:37:40,804 --> 00:37:44,474
Chit for sanctions, propaganda.
Maybe they don't know yet.

304
00:37:44,557 --> 00:37:46,934
So, what's your confession?

305
00:37:47,561 --> 00:37:52,690
Well, Amber's been good to the Agency,
and I'm personally tight with her brother.

306
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:54,900
He's done a lot of favors for us in Iraq.

307
00:37:54,985 --> 00:37:57,625
On the one hand, we have loyalty
and our integrity as human beings.

308
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:00,949
On the other hand, the price of loyalty,
in this case, is very high.

309
00:38:01,032 --> 00:38:03,242
So there's an upside
to cutting ties right now.

310
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:05,161
But I still don't see how it's my problem.

311
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:06,996
Well, I'm trying one last idea.

312
00:38:08,581 --> 00:38:10,791
We could help Bambi knock the place over.

313
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:14,003
Don't put any of this on my desk.

314
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:54,144
Hey.

315
00:40:29,222 --> 00:40:30,514
It's not a good time.

316
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:33,976
You're scared. It's cool.

317
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:41,985
Can I be rough?

318
00:40:42,068 --> 00:40:43,402
I don't know, can you?

319
00:40:44,905 --> 00:40:47,364
Is it "yes," or is it "no"?

320
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:49,659
Yeah.

321
00:40:59,085 --> 00:41:00,085
I changed my mind.

322
00:41:01,463 --> 00:41:04,298
What the fuck are we doing?
This is bullshit.

323
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:07,594
It's not.

324
00:41:08,762 --> 00:41:11,306
I was pretty clear about my motivations.

325
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:15,518
You're going through a lot 'cause
you're injured and your wife's in hell,

326
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:18,813
and that, I'm here to be
the companion in the hard times.

327
00:41:18,896 --> 00:41:21,942
Well, thank you, but I-I don't need it.

328
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:26,362
And I don't want it.

329
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:29,532
What about me? What about what I want?

330
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:39,125
- You're so handsome.
- Jesus.

331
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,710
- Do you always do that?
- What?

332
00:41:40,793 --> 00:41:43,128
Just push away compliments?

333
00:41:43,213 --> 00:41:45,882
When they spring from ulterior motives,
yeah.

334
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:50,177
Handsome but so sensitive.

335
00:41:50,262 --> 00:41:52,347
Trust me, nobody has ever said that.

336
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:58,853
Well, maybe the people in your
life don't really see you for who you are.

337
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:02,983
I'm an outside observer here, but yeah,
you're sensitive,

338
00:42:03,942 --> 00:42:06,652
and you're just trying really hard
not to show it.

339
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:12,951
Come on. Empathy. Psychological insight.

340
00:42:15,161 --> 00:42:18,081
And now I'm literally on my knees for you.

341
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:23,753
You have to admit, mmm,
it's a pretty strong offer.
