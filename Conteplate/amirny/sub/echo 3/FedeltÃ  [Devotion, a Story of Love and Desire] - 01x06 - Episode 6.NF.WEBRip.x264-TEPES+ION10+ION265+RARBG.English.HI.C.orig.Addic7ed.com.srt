[Margherita] Hey!

00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:50,708
Oh, one sec!

28
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,750
I'll be right back.

29
00:01:58,958 --> 00:01:59,958
Excuse me.

38
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,583
Hi. I'm, uh, the owner of this phone.

39
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,750
Tchaikovsky!

40
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,541

Is this the girl from Bar Basso?</i>

Well, that's two points for you, I guess.

46
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,833
Why am I getting points?

47
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,875
For one, you recognized Tchaikovsky
from just the first few notes,

48
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,708
and two, because you're not a thief.

49

Where should I meet you?

- Okay.

61
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,166
Have they told you anything?

62
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,333
Are you okay?

63
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,601
[Margherita] <i>Well, it'll be a while
before I can run again,</i>

64
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,833
<i>but I'll survive.</i>

00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,833
Listen, uh... So I'm here,
but I don't know where I'm going.

[Margherita] <i>Just keep walking.</i>

68
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,250
Why don't you tell me what room it is?

[Margherita] <i>Just keep going
straight ahead.</i>

70

[sighs]

71
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,541
So I'm basically
at the end of the path here.

72
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,625
[Margherita] <i>Okay.
Can you see the flowers?</i>

73
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,625
Yes. The flowers, they're right here.

74
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,791
Now what?
I'm at the flowers, where do I go?

75
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,208
Hmm?

76
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,625
[Margherita] <i>Oh, red.</i>

77
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:07,958
Great choice.

78
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,875
[Carlo] <i>Come on. Where are you?</i>

79
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,541
[Margherita] <i>Look to your left.</i>

80
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,166
It's pretty serious, huh?

81
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,541
You really hurt yourself.

82
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,500
<i>It is. It was someone else's fault too.</i>

83
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,333
<i>Well then, I guess
I'll make it up to you. Okay?</i>

84
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,625
[Margherita] How are you gonna do that?

85
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,666
<i>Way too easy.</i>

86
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,791
<i>I lead you over here to the flowers.</i>

87
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:36,958
<i>All right.</i>

88
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,958
<i>Let's see what you can come up with.</i>

89
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,908
<i>- Okay.</i>
- [Margherita chuckles]

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,458
Attraction is just a fleeting moment.

92

Everything is destined to end.

93
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,458
It's a bit of a strong message.

94
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,041
Is that what you think your book's about?

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,916
I guess. It is pretty depressing.

96
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:09,791
No.

97
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,125
Why?

98
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,333
If that's what you wanna say, go ahead.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,166
Just focus in more
on that concept. Okay? Hmm?

100
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,375
Bring me that new draft
next time you come. All right?

101
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,458
[groans]

102
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,250
Thanks. I absolutely will. Thanks again.

103
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,833
- See you soon.
- You bet.

104
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh!

105
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,083
[Luca] Oh!

106
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,541
Look who I brought by to see you.

107
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,000
[Carlo] Sofia!

108
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,083
Hey.

109
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,333
[Carlo] How are you?

110
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,059
- [Sofia moans happily]
- How was your trip?

111
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,875
- [Sofia] Fine. I really miss Milan.
- Is your dad with you?

112
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,291
Yes. He went to see the Duomo. [chuckles]

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
- I'm glad.
- Yes. It's great. Wonderful.

114
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,958
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Yes! Yes!

115
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,208
Look... look what I have.

116
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,708
The very first copy.
Fresh off the press for you.

[Sofia gasps]

118
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,333
- [Sofia] Oh my gosh. It's amazing!
- Soak it all in.

119
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,916
It won't be your only novel, though.
Well, I hope not.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,875
Exactly right.

121
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,851
- These copies are for you.
- [cell phone ringing]

122
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:05,875
Excuse me for a minute.

123
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,041
Hi, Anna!

124
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,625
Yeah. We're still on for lunch.

125
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,166
Actually, you know what else?

126
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,708
I'm bringing you another book. A new one.

127
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,750
On sale, tomorrow.

How far are we?

132
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,125
Just under six kilometers.

133
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,833
[Andrea] And... stop!

134
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,916
[both panting]

135
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,125
We needed that.

136
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,666
Brush off all the tension.

137
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,715
[Andrea] Everything's ready
for tonight, right?

138
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:55,791
It is.

139
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,666
No need to worry, then.

140
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,916
I'll see you around 7:00,
unless, uh, you need more time?

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,875
No, eight. seven is too early.
I'll never be ready by then.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,680
That's a friend of mine. I'm gonna say hi.

143
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,083
- Okay.
- See you tonight.

Carlo?

148
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,291
- [Carlo] Hi.
- Hey.

149
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,250
Mom.

150
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,333
Are you okay? What's going on?

151
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,541
Ugh. I hurt my leg. I ran into the table.

152
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,666
It's terrible.

153
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,541
Imagine if Carlo hadn't been there.

154
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,865
[Carlo] I spoke to the surgeon.

155
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,458
The fracture's displaced,
but it's nothing serious.

156
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,541
He said the operation's really standard.

157
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,208
[sighs] So they're operating?

158
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,875
I can't expect this to heal itself.

159
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,166
[doctor] All right, ma'am. Are you ready?

160
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,333
- [Anna groans]
- All right. Excuse me.

161
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,541
Let's go, let's go. Huh.

162
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,833
- Bye, Anna.
- See you, Carlo.

163
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:21,916
Bye, sweetheart.

164
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,750
I'll be here, okay?

Carlo, thanks.

168
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,000
Well, of course.

How you doing?

171
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,416
I'm well.

172
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,541
And you?

173
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,333
I'm good.

174
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,375
If you don't mind,
I'd love to be here for the operation.

175
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,583
Sure.

00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,166
So you were having lunch with my mother?

181
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,750
Yeah.

182
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,208
You know, we have lunch from time to time.

183
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:42,958
We don't talk about you.

184
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,041
[laughs]

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,875
Sorry. I had better respond
to this message.

186
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:49,958
Yeah. Go ahead.

187
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,416
[cell phone chimes]

188
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,708
Hi, Eva. I'm still in the hospital
waiting on Mom's operation.

189
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,375
It's nothing serious,
but I need to wait here.

190
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,375
Could you please just
let all of the guests on your list know

191
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,625
that the opening is being postponed,
but we'll let them know soon?

192
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:06,750
Thanks again.

193
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:07,833
[cell phone chimes]

194
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,250
Finally opening your own studio.

195
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,291
[chuckles]

196
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,541
- So she does tell you things.
- Well...

197
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,041
[chuckles]

198
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,166
I actually knew about the project,

199
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,666
but not that today was the official start.

200
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,375
Well, I hear
that you've been making big improvements.

201
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,916
So I suppose she told you
a few things about me?

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
[chuckles]

203
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,208
That's all she said. [chuckles]

204
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,541
[footsteps approaching]

205
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,833
[Marcello] Margherita.

206
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,666
[Margherita] Hi.

207
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,750
How's your mom doing?

208
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,958
She's in surgery,
but luckily it's nothing serious.

209
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,559
- [Marcello] That's good.
- [Margherita] Yeah.

210
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,291
Marcello, this is Carlo.

211
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,541
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

212
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,416
Well...

213
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,708
I better go.

214
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,916
- Thanks for everything, Carlo.
- Of course.

215
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,934
- Let me know how she's doing.
- [Margherita] Of course.

216
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:05,958
Bye.

217
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,708
And you? How are you?

218
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,083
I'm fine, fine.

219
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,000
Uh, I'm a little bit nervous, but...

220
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,916
I hope it all goes well.

221
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,291
Of course. Do you need anything?
Can I do anything?

222
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,333
[Margherita] No. That's okay.
Thank you for coming.

223
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,916
[melancholy music playing]

224
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,708
How are you feeling, Mom?

225
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,833
[groans] Just perky.

226
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:42,916
[chuckles]

227
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,916
I'm sorry that this ruined your event.

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
No.

229
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,458
The important thing
is that you're doing better.

230
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,125
My party will wait.

231
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,916
Are you kidding? No.
You're going to have it tomorrow!

232
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,708
I want you to be there too.

233
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,000
Margherita,

234
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,291
don't wait for me.

235
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,833
In fact, it's important
your business opens, and don't argue.

236
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,250
[dramatic music playing]

237
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,750
You can go now, sweetheart.
I'm fine. Go on.

238
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,500
I need some rest.

239
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,500
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- [Anna] Mm.

240
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,583
Hey. Will you bring that book by Buzzati?

241
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,666
Of course.

242
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,875
[both blow kisses]

243
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,708
[cell phone ringing]

244
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,541
Carlo, hi!

245
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:38,291
Yes. The surgery went smoothly.
Everything's just fine.

246
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,416
Oh. What did I say?
Nothing to worry about. See?

247
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,375
Now, just a little physical therapy

248
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,125
and then you'll be back
on your feet before you know it.

249
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,458
Yeah.

250
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,083
[chuckles] Sure.

251
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,541
Is she with you?

252
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,000
No. Poor thing. I made her go and rest.

253
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,208
She was beat.

254
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:56,791
Okay.

255
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,708
Okay.

256
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,166
Well then, Anna, get some rest.

257
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,791
Have a good night. Call you tomorrow.

258
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,083
[groans] Have a good night, Carlo.

259
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,166
Thank you.

260
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,458
Oh!

261
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,166
What's going on in here?

262
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,625
I mean, where did all your clothes go?

263
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,208
[girl chuckles]

264
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,208
[Carlo moans]

265
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:20,791
[Carlo chuckles]

266
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,895
- [light switch clicks]
- [door closes]

267
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,958
Are you hungry? We could order something.

268
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,500
Hmm. I'm not hungry.

269
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,375
Honestly, I'm exhausted.

270
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,416
Of course. I know this has all been a lot.

271
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,583
But everything's okay now.

272
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,833
Yes. You're right.

273
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,166
Want me to stay with you tonight?

274
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,458
It's up to you.

275
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,833
I'll be passed out
any minute, though. [chuckles]

276
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,000
[laughs] Well, it's your house,

277
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,375
so it's up to you.

278
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,291
Come on.

279
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,583
You're staying here.

280
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,958
[dramatic music playing]

281
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,541
I had a good time.

282
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,583
Me too.

283
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,750
You know,
you could sleep here if you want.

284
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:35,875
[girl] That's okay.

285
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,166
I'd rather be in my own bed.

286
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:40,666
Okay.

287
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,833
[chuckles]

288
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:42,916
Bye.

289
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,666
WHEN WE STOP PLAYING
PREMIO CAMPIELLO

290
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,541
CARLO PENTECOSTE,
FROM WRITER TO TALENT SCOUT

291
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,791
SOFIA CASADEI AND HER NOVEL
THE WAY THINGS ARE

292
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,708
WILL BE PRESENTED TOMORROW
BY CARLO PENTECOSTE

293
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,833
How was it seeing her again?

294
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,125
[both chuckling]

295
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,166
How is she doing?

296
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,291
She's doing really well.

297
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,500
A little too well.

298
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,500
- Too well?
- Hmm.

299
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Yep.

300
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,000
I mean, she looked amazing.

301
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,333
Even more beautiful
than when she was with me.

302
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,833
To me, she's changed.

303
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,666
- [Marco] How so?
- Well, um...

304
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,250
She seems stronger.

305
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,500
Her expression was different.

306
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,791
I mean, do you think
maybe at this exact moment

307
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,833
she's talking about
how good she that thought you looked?

308
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,375
[Giulia] How was he? Hmm?

309
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,541
- [Margherita] Normal.
- I knew it.

310
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,291
Same shirt and glasses, huh?

311
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,041
Yeah. Just normal. He seemed good.

312
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,541
So you were looking at him?

313
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,166
- Of course I was. He was there.
- [Giulia giggles]

314
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,500
Anyway, it was strange.

315
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,250
- What do you mean?
- [Margherita] It was strange. Don't know.

316
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,375
It's like that with exes.
Strange, you know?

317
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,666
- Yeah.
- Well, what did you say to each other?

318
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,750
[jazz music playing]

319
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,000
Nothing really.

320
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,708
He was really kind. That was nice.

321
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,041
- Oh. I mean, that's good. Right?
- [chuckles]

322
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,916
What was he supposed to do? Attack her?

323
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,291
He stayed with her at the hospital.
He didn't have to.

324
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,875
- [Margherita chuckles]
- Hey. Wasn't Marcello there?

325
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,083
- Oh. You were surrounded.
- [Margherita scoffs]

326
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,875
- And you loved it!
- Stop it!

327
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,041
[all laughing]

328
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,458
You know what the fucked up part is?

329
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,958
I was with her
the night they first saw each other.

330
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,291
What night was that?

331
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,666
Uh, at the gallery's opening night.

332
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,625
[gasps] Okay.

333
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,458
It was a nice night.
I can remember it all now.

334
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,583
A very passionate evening.

335
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,333
Anyway...

336
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,750
By the way, for my personal taste,

337
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,781
I think his work is a little...

338
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,958
Look. I don't fucking understand it.

339
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,833
What the hell is it supposed to be?

340
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,375
Thank you. Thank you.

341
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,791
Anyway, what I'm saying is

342
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:28,791
that exes have this pain-in-the-ass way
of making you feel paranoid.

343
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,416
So, it's best
to avoid seeing them altogether.

344
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,291
Yes, but only if the past
has been fully resolved.

345
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,750
What do you mean?

346
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,750
Just that maybe there's
unfinished business with you and Carlo.

347
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,767
- [Eva] You crazy? It's been a year.
- They never talked about what happened.

348
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,416
- Because that makes it worse!
- Stop it!

349
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,041
No. That's enough
from both of you. We're over.

350
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:46,958
[both chuckle]

351
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,125
Okay, but admit it.

352
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,750
Okay. Admit what?

353
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,250
That you haven't settled everything
with you and Carlo.

354
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
[cell phone chimes]

355
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,541
GIULIA: I THINK
SHE WAS ENTHRALLED BY HIM TOO

356
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,833

Even better, then.
I'm gonna take off my coat.

529
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,333
Don't go anywhere.

530
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:16,541
[house music playing]

531
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:19,500
- Oh, there she is. You're gorgeous.
- You look spectacular.

532
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:20,791
[Sofia] I'll be right back.

533
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:24,833
- Oh, here she is. Our child prodigy!
- [Sofia] Hey.

534
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,583
- I'm gonna go get a refill. I'm empty.
- [Sofia chuckles]

535
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,375
- See you in a bit, Ada.
- See you later.

536
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,958
- She's very important.
- Oh, really?

537
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:32,125
Oh yes!

538
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:34,208
[both laugh]

539
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:38,375
Today is just the best day of my life.

540
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:39,583
By far.

541
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:40,666
Well, good.

542
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,458
You deserve it all.

543
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,083
You'll have to be my editor forever.

544
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:47,416
Why not? Although, it might be hard
to meet with me in person.

545
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
[Sofia] Why?

546
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:52,541
- [whispers] There's a chance I'm leaving.
- To where?

547
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:53,708
[Carlo] Paris.

548
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:54,791
Paris?

549
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:59,625
There's an office in Paris,
and I guess they want me there.

550
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:01,375
To new beginnings!

551
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:03,791
Yes, Luca, she's here.
He's looking for you.

552
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:06,708
Excuse me. Sofia, let me introduce you
to someone very important.

553
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,059
- [Sofia] Sure.
- [Luca] Come on.

554
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,875
Listen. Why don't you tell them
that story you told me earlier?

555
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,458
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

556
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:18,708
Attention please.

557
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:22,500
[Eva] Yes. Because our girl,
Margherita, has a little speech to make.

558
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:24,333
- [Margherita] No! No!
- Yes.

559
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:26,291
- Over to you. Come on.
- [Margherita chuckles]

560
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,333
Fine! Okay.

561
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:29,291
[breathes deeply]

562
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:30,500
So, um,

563
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,916
I'd like to say
that I feel really confident

564
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:38,000
and I'm not even the least bit scared.

565
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,500
But I don't wanna lie!

566
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:41,916
[all laughing]

567
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:43,708
I am very scared.

568
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:45,791
I'm terrified, really.

569
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:46,875
[dramatic music playing]

570
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,208
Um,

571
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:51,958
for me, this studio represents a dream.

572
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:56,416
A dream that has been locked
in a drawer for far too long.

573
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,083
Actually, in a box.

574
00:27:58,166 --> 00:28:00,041
[chuckles] No. I mean it because...

575
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:04,416
Well, 'cause one day I opened a box
filled with these old things of mine,

576
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,416
uh, they'd been forgotten.

577
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,458
Like my diploma,

578
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:12,083
notebooks from university
filled with ideas.

579
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:15,708
And that was the moment
I knew I was keeping the box open.

580
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:19,333
I knew that it had to bring me here today

581
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:22,000
with all of you, to... [chuckles]

582
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,500
...to celebrate a new start.

583
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,833
Because this is a new start for me.

584
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,166
Thank you.

585
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,791
I hope you all need to redecorate
your homes in the near future!

586
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,125
[all laughing]

587
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:37,875
And if you do, I hope
that you will think of me. [chuckles]

588
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:39,958
- [Giulia] Cheers!
- [all] Cheers!

589
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:41,083
[woman] Whoo!

590
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:43,541
[house music playing]

591
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,375
- [glass clatters]
- Thanks.

592
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,583
- Great party.
- Yeah. It is.

593
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,916
Every single person who matters is here.

594
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,166
Sorry. I'm hiding with you
because I don't know anyone here.

595
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,125
Well, I only know a quarter of the guests.

596
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,583
That's not counting the ones
I only know through email.

597
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,000
[Carlo chuckles]

598
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:08,043
You know, I wanted
to read Sofia's book, actually.

599
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,166
- Wait. Really?
- [Marco] Yes!

600
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,833
You want a free copy, don't you?

601
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,666
- [laughing]
- Oh. Come on!

602
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,875
No, I'll buy it. I'll buy it. I swear.

603
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:20,250
Yeah. You'd better. That goes
towards author and publishing rights.

604
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:22,500
Excuse me?
Can I get two jagers with lemon, please?

605
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:23,943
And they're on this guy over here.

606
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,083
No, no! Sorry. No, no, no, no. Just one.

607
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,541

00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:41,208
Great. Marcello, this is Flavio.

610

- Hey. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

612

I love your work very much.

that you're a lucky man as well.

- Very!

615
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:52,125
I'm sure you have a lot to talk about.

616
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,333
Just give me a minute.

I'm sorry too.

Don't you recognize it?

<i>It goes well with your studio.</i>

630
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,000
You haven't seen it.

631
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,083
[Carlo] <i>Well, I...</i>

632
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,083
<i>Uh, I'm trying to imagine it.</i>

633
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:35,375
<i>Let's see.
You've chosen bold colors for the walls,</i>

634
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:39,125
<i>an excellent selection of lamps.</i>

635
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:41,666
<i>So it's well lit.</i>

636
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:43,791
That's true.

637
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,333
[Carlo] <i>Ground floor,</i>

638

<i>Right?</i>

640
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:53,958
Uh, yeah.

641
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:57,000
That all was pretty predictable, though.

00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:00,583
[Carlo] <i>You're not wearing
a pant-suit. No jacket.</i>

<i>Am I close?</i>

646
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,250
You're good at imagining.

647
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,625
[Carlo] Concordia was the right address.

648
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:44,958
Even though we didn't know why.

A wonderful couple.
They always agree on everything.

Hey. What if I never mentioned it to you?

656
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,250
- What's that?
- Back at the college.

657
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,458
The misunderstanding.

658
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:10,916
Have you ever wondered?

659
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:13,833
I do, often.

661
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:17,916
But even still,

662
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:20,708
it was never going to work with us.

00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,375

about you a lot, you know?

I really try not to.

Just can't help it.

670
00:32:35,833 --> 00:32:38,791
Being together was important,
especially when we were apart.

since we broke it off,

[sighs]

677
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:00,375
[Carlo] You need to go back in.

678
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,541
- It's your party.
- Yes. Hmm.

679
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,333
[both chuckle lightly]

680
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:08,916
I know you're gonna do great.

681
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,250
Hmm.

682
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,750
So what now?

683
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:29,916
I don't know.

684
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:33,125
